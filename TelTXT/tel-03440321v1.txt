Acknowledgments
Jérôme Ballet, for throwing me in at the deep end. Allowing me to freely conduct my
research project, while keeping a watchful eye, have made these years a highlight in my
education. His continuous and unconditional presence made him an exceptional mentor,
both in the field and in the office.
Mario Biggeri and Caroline Hart, for accepting to take on the role of rapporteurs for this
thesis. Their seminal contributions to the capability approach and their methodologies
have been an inspiration to me for years.
Bruno Boidin and Jean-Luc Dubois, for accepting to be part of the jury of this thesis.
Emmanuel Petit deserves a special thanks, for accepting to preside the jury under highly
unusual circumstances. There could nevertheless not have been a more appropriate person
to take on this role.
The University of Bordeaux and the GREThA, for hosting my research and the teaching
experience I was able to acquire with its students.
Drs. Sylvia Mels-Vos, Lady of Glencoe and Lochaber and Drs.Berry Lambertus Vos, Laird
of Glencoe and Lochaber, Mum and Dad, their unfailing love, their aspirations where mine
failed, and the entire education they gave me, are all that made me. I can never thank
them enough.
Eva and Ilse, mijn kleine zusjes, their sororal love has always been a great drive.
Lucile Marchand, tout son amour, sa patience et son incompréhensible compréhension
m’ont été d’une aide sans égal. Je ne pourrais jamais être assez reconnaissant pour sa
présence.
Alexandra Elbakyan, for her courageous initiative. Without her disclosure of public knowledge, this thesis would have been impossible to document.
I have a special thought for those with whom I have worked and played over the years.
Marjorie and Tomi, for the countless hours of board games and bottles of questionable
wine. Dan, Lucie, Erwan, Léo (in order of appearance) for making the office an actual
nice place to be. Last but certainly not least, Xavier, for his mathematical rigor, his
inspiring love for golfing and sharing my passions.

I would also like to thank all the staff of the schools which kindly hosted this research
and all the students who accepted to participate in this study, without whom this thesis
would have been impossible, and would have made absolutely no sense.

Education, Well-Being and Aspirations; a Capability based Analysis of the Secondary
Schooling System in France.
Abstract
This thesis proposes to explore the academic inquiries of economic science into education
by focusing on its evolution over time and the associated theoretical implications. It will
then provide a chronological study of the notions of well-being and aspirations from the
standpoint of economic theory while attaching importance to highlight when these notions
meet each other in these theoretical formulations (Part I). Findings of Economics of Education and its disregard of pupils well-being and aspirations will lead to the exploration
of the Capability Approach as an alternative theoretical framework (Part II). Finally,
this thesis proposes an application of the Capability Approach to the French secondary
schooling system. It does so by constructing a questionnaire through focus groups and
evaluating its outcomes with multidimensional statistics (Part III). This operationalization allows establishing a link between well-being and school-related aspirations through
a new methodology.

Résumé
Cette thèse propose d’explorer la conceptualisation de l’éducation dans la science économique en se concentrant sur son évolution dans le temps et les implications théoriques
associées. Elle effectuera ensuite une exploration chronologique des notions de bien-être
et d’aspirations du point de vue de la théorie économique, tout en cherchant à mettre
en exergue lorsque ces notions se rencontrent dans leurs formulations théoriques (Partie
I). L’économie de l’éducation, et sa négligence du bien-être et des aspirations des élèves,
mènera à l’exploration de l’approche par les capabilités comme un cadre théorique alternatif (Partie II). Enfin, cette thèse propose d’appliquer l’approche par les capabilités au
système d’éducation secondaire en France. Elle le fait en construisant un questionnaire à
l’aide de groupes de discussion et en évaluant les résultats grâce à des statistiques multidimensionnelles (Partie III). Cette opérationnalisation permet d’identifier un lien entre le
bien-être et les aspirations liés à l’école à travers une méthodologie nouvelle.

Reason attempts to bring elements of a response to these interrogations. They are
even now, three centuries after this philosopher has first formulated them, astonishingly
accurate and pertinent. Despite the fact that they seem to be simple and concise interrogations, they give way to both interesting and concrete answers. Their short and simple
formulation allows many to relate to any of these three questions and thus identify with
Kant’s philosophy. In the context of this thesis, the German philosopher’s questions seem
to be an appropriate starting point. He will also accompany the reader in a vast majority
of the epigraphs, reflecting the wide scope of his philosophical inquiries.

T

The first question is described as “purely speculative” by Kant (Kant 1922, p. 646).
He considers that this question is only a means to an end. This end is the two more
“practical” questions that follow. Moreover, he clearly indicated that “knowledge can
never fall to our lot” (Kant 1922, p. 646), in other words, knowledge will never be entirely
acquired as such. Knowledge will thus have an instrumental, yet determinant role in
the answering of the two following questions. When considering education to be a way
to acquire knowledge, it may be understood as a vector, a means to be more able to
answer correctly to the practical and concrete questions that follow. Contrary to the
first interrogation, Kant specifies the second question to be “purely practical” (Kant
1922, p. 646) and related to morality, a code of conduct to be adopted. He understands
1



INTRODUCTION
morality, or “law of morality” as the rule that “dictates how we ought to conduct ourselves
in order to deserve happiness.” (Kant 1922, p. 647).
The third and last question offers a particularly interesting insight for this thesis.
This question is double-fold for Kant; he explains that this question “is at the same
time practical and theoretical, the practical serving as a guidance to the answer to the
theoretical and, in its highest form, speculative question; for all hoping is directed towards
happiness and is, with regard to practical interests and the law of morality, the same
as knowing and the law of nature, with regard to the theoretical cognition of things.”
(Kant 1922, p. 647). Two central notions of this thesis are thus mentioned by Kant
in the development of his last question. He develops the notion of hope, which can be
understood, at least partially, as aspiring. He explains that every aspiration is oriented
towards happiness, which we can reformulate, in a certain manner, to well-being.
These very brief explorations of Kant’s fundamental questions allow to bring forth
the linkages which I will attempt to further shed light on in this thesis. Kant’s questions
show that there exists a certain relationship between aspirations and well-being since
any aspiration is “directed towards happiness” (Kant 1922, p. 647). They also allow for
the “practical serving as a guidance” (Kant 1922, p. 647). The practical is indeed what
motivated the writing of this thesis, stemming directly from experiences as a volunteer,
an educational assistant, and a teacher. More specifically, the importance of aspirations,
the reflection of pupils on their schooling experience and what they expect from school
has always been a major practical drive for the further exploration of this specific theme
within school. As a volunteer with children in difficult situations relating to school (either
persistently lower grades, behavior or because they did not speak french), a colleague
appeared to be particularly resigned. He found that our efforts to assist these pupils were
often in vain, and one day said to me: “there is no point in attempting to make a donkey
drink if it is not thirsty”. This metaphor is very similar in form and probably identical in
content to the English proverb which says that “you can lead a horse to water, but you
can’t make it drink”. It is difficult to disagree with such a statement but appears to me
as placing the focus on the wrong objective. I responded by saying that “we should not
try to make the donkey drink, we should figure out how to make it thirsty”.
This discussion then sparked my curiosity and coupled with the discovery of economics of education, it appeared that a wide-ranged field of inquiry lay open for exploration. Economics of education does indeed not appear to mention any form of ‘aspiration’
that would drive a pupil to invest in their own education. Besides the hope of a ‘good’,
well-paid job, economic analysis does not tie any importance to other intrinsic values of
education. Many pupils I have had the opportunity to work with were unable to understand the point of studying mathematics, physics or other languages. As a consequence,
2



INTRODUCTION
some of them entirely discarded any form of interest in school, and would rather just start
working to earn money directly. Economics of education may to some extent integrate
this and would interpret such a decision as a non-willingness to ‘invest’ in education.
Nevertheless, a variety of reasons may motivate a pupil to skip school entirely and start
working. The diversity of such reasons and their pertinence are left aside by economic
theory.
The difficulty to properly shape and fulfill their aspirations appears to extend beyond secondary education for a considerable amount of students. While writing this
thesis I taught several promotions of first-year students, whom I all asked to introduce
themselves1 . A vast majority of these students were there for one of two reasons. The
predominant one, was them being there ‘by default’. This relates to students who were
there because they had no other idea of what they wanted to do, without displaying a
specific motivation to do something else. The second reason was that the student getting
rejected from another path. When coupling this with the extremely low success rates
of those first year’s students (hovering somewhere between 20-25%), it appeared to me
that there was a major issue with the shaping and achievement of these student’s true
aspirations.
All of these experiences motivated this thesis greatly and underlined the pertinence
of the questions that drove this study. They also contribute to the application of the
theoretical findings to the French secondary schooling system. As discussed further, very
few adaptations of the capability approach have been made for France. Alongside the
previously exposed hypotheses and intuitions, France emerges as a field in which the
reconsideration of elements of its secondary schooling system, in the light of the capability
approach, may shed light on some of its shortcomings.
It appears crucial to consider the pertinence of the exploration of such hypotheses in
the scope of economic science. Economics provides a relatively solid and simple answer
to the question of ‘why education?’. In a nutshell, the more ‘traditional’ scholars consider
that education is justified in economic terms through the finding that more education accounts for higher productivity. This, in turn, allows higher salaries and therefore, a more
booming economy. In such a manner, education has a quite direct and positive translation into economic aggregates, namely wages, and Gross Domestic Product for example.
Despite this illustration being oversimplified, it does convey the fact that economists do
find an economic justification for education (and have extensively researched it under
the economic lens) but it also shows that economists do not appear to ask any follow-up
questions. This thesis then proposes to expand the inquiry of economists beyond the sole
1

The conclusions I draw from this experience have no statistical power whatsoever and are evidently
completely circumstantial.

INTRODUCTION
aggregates which are conservatively approved by their science. By enhancing the inquiry
of education, and the associated notions of aspirations and well-being, it may also be
found that increasing education qualitatively, can lead to an increase in economic aggregates. In such a manner, expanding on the importance of aspirations and well-being as
impacting academic performance, may result in these notions to have (in)direct economic
consequences.
This gives place to the first set of questions this thesis will focus on. To what extent does
economic theory allow to understand and transcribe the diversity of attitudes, decisions,
and aspirations pupils may have regarding school? Moreover, do economics of education
provide adequate modelization to achieve its own objectives?
Part I will then explore and attempt to show the inefficacy of ‘traditional’ economic
theory with regard to its own objectives. It will do so by reviewing economic theory,
specifically economics of education, while also exploring the notions of aspirations and
well-being. By adding these two notions, traditionally absent from economic theory, this
thesis will attempt to provide insight into some of the missing dimensions when considering
education. As mentioned, the absence of these notions may result in an inefficient manner
of considering education, even if it merely attempts to evaluate its outcomes in terms of
economic aggregates. Throughout the chronological review of economics of education,
attempts will be made to find periods where economic theory incorporates the notions of
well-being and aspirations. The following chapters will then delve deeper into these latter
two concepts.
This first part will also permit to shed light on the underlying theoretical considerations on education, well-being, and aspirations from other social sciences. As economic
science is (arguably) a social science, psychology, sociology, and anthropology may provide constructive insights into the complex notions that will be explored. The inquiry
into these neighboring sciences will further conclude to some of the shortcomings of economic theory with regards to education and the necessity to find a more appropriate,
comprehensive framework for a better understanding of education.
Secondly, importance will be attached to finding an appropriate theoretical framework
for the marriage of these three complex notions, while remaining consistent with economic
theory. Part II will explore the capability approach as initially coined by Amartya Sen and
further developed by many scholars. This approach contrasts starkly with classical economic viewpoints on education, well-being, and aspirations. Nevertheless, this framework
appears to be a pertinent one since it originates from economic literature. Sen’s background as an economist, and as a laureate of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic
Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, makes the foundation of his framework very much
4



INTRODUCTION
economic. With its roots spanning from development economics to social choice theory,
the capability approach has found applications in a variety of fields, ranging beyond the
borders of sole economics.
Where education is an abundantly discussed notion in economic literature, identifying it’s widespread repercussions, the concept of aspirations is largely abandoned. The
shift from mainstream economic literature to that of the capability approach will, therefore, allow reinstating a meaningful understanding of well-being. The exploration of this
framework for the evaluation of education and the associated concepts of well-being and
aspirations will be done throughout Part II. The underlying questions that drive this
second part will expand upon the first set of questions. Can the links between education, well-being, and aspirations be comprehensively theorized? If so, to what extent
does education impact well-being and aspirations, and furthermore, do aspirations impact education? Finally, if this framework appears to identify these linkages, can they be
measured, and if so, how?
Thirdly and finally, I will adapt the theoretical framework of the capability approach
to a case study. As such, the last part will be dedicated to the operationalization of the
approach with French high school youngsters. I will draw on existing studies from Biggeri
et al. 2006 and Hart 2012 to implement focus groups in French high schools. These
purely qualitative inquiries will then result in a questionnaire adapted to the specifics
of French high schools. These questionnaires will yield an ordinal qualitative database
which will then be analyzed using two distinct, yet complementary methodologies of
multidimensional statistics. The usage of multiple cluster analysis, complemented with
hierarchical cluster analysis, provide insight into the data without determining an a priori
model and thus allow the identification of relations without a pre-existent model. This
initial exploration will allow answering the question: are there any empirically verifiable
links between education, well-being, and aspirations? Once some links identified and
verified, Part III will propose a final econometric model in order to verify and strengthen
the initially exposed relationships. This last model then gives deeper insight into the
impact of different dimensions in the questionnaire on school-related aspirations.

ducation has been subject to research for a considerable amount of time. Forms
of formal education have been identified in France since the 5th century Before the
Common Era (Rouche 2003). These systems were complete with an entire cast of teachers
and specific teachings. The complexity and the considerable evolution of educational
practices, institutions and studies have kept it a field of interest very much alive amongst
scholars. It is not only a domain of interest for educationalists and historians but also
rallies philosophers, sociologists, and economists who reflect upon it. All these academic
inquiries have been very much present in human societies, under one form or another.

E

The word education as we understand it nowadays can be led back to several origins.
One reference is that of educatio, found in classical Latin, which is the verb for ‘raise’
or ‘breed’. Closer to our understanding of education in the 21st century, we also find in
classic Latin educere. It is the composition of two words, e which means ‘out’ and ducere
which stands for ‘lead’ or ‘drawing’. Close to the Kantian understanding of uneducated
human beings who are “naturally wild (...) [and] raw.” (Kant 1904, p. 225) the etymology
seems to contain the very purpose of the word. Education is thus to be understood as a
necessary stage in the life of a human being.

CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
This chapter will be dedicated to the exploration of how economic science has taken
up the term of education and introduced it into its theorization. This will lead me
to conclude to a staggering lack of understanding of economists of the very role and
purpose of education. An attempt will then be made to delve into other social sciences
and humanities to gain insight for economic theory as to the way education is to be
theorized. As I move through the different phases of development of the field of economics
of education, I will attempt to draw links to the notions of well-being and aspirations and
assess their position with regards to education in economic science.

2.1

Economics of Education, a chronological review

Economics of education as such is a relatively young field of inquiry in economics.
This is particularly true when one considers the ancient Greek roots of economics as initiated by Aristotle. This was thus only an embryo of modern economics which encompasses
many more domains of research than the sole household management.
When referring to economics of education in modern economics, many authors limit
their explorations to the hegemonic human capital theory. This is illustrated by a seminal book by Mark Blaug “Economics of Education” in which he attempts to “define the
nature and scope of (...) economics of education.” (Blaug 1966, p. vii). In this “Selected
Annotated Bibliography” Blaug’s earliest reference is from 1841 (Mann 1841). In this
paper, Mann testifies “to the superior productivity of educated over uneducated workers
in similar occupations, and, also, touches on most of the now-familiar “indirect benefits”
of education” (Blaug 1966, p. 6). This is a very clear foreshadowing of the rise of human
capital, 120 years before it’s time. George Psacharopoulos adds that economics of education “only formally appeared as such in the literature in the early 1960’s” (Psacharopoulos
1987, p. xv) thus referring to human capital theory.
This vision has been more clearly specified by Woodhall who delimits economics of
education to the studies of “the contribution of education to economic growth, the profitability of investment in education (including estimates of the social and private returns
to education), the role of educated manpower in economic development (including attempts to forecast manpower requirements), the costs of education (including questions
of cost-effectiveness and productivity), the finance of education and more recently studies of the effects of education on the distribution of income and wealth.” (Woodhall,
in Psacharopoulos 1987, p. 1). It is to be noted now that economics of education have
not been identified as such by the earlier authors I will discuss here. Their contributions
mainly lie in their studies of the contributions of manpower and labor to economic devel10



2.1. ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION, A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW
opment. This field overlaps very largely with modern labor economics but it nevertheless
lays the foundations for what will be called economics of education centuries later.
I argue that economics of education finds its roots long before the formalization
of human capital. Despite these rich roots, human capital theory has since the early
1960’s monopolized the landscape of economics of education. This has led many scholars
and institutions to be unable to see beyond its theoretical scope. In this section, I will
attempt to draw upon some of the few authors who have analyzed economics of education
as a larger concept than mere human capital. This will allow reinstating this field of
inquiry in its full magnitude. Moreover, it will give a more complete understanding of the
shortcomings of the hegemonic human capital models. This starts with an exploration of
writings which precede classical economics leading to human capital. From there I will
attempt to move beyond this theoretical framework by incorporating elements of other
social sciences and humanities.

2.1.1

Mercantilism

As noted by De Meulemeester, the earliest author who can be associated with economics of education is William Petty (De Meulemeester 2007). Petty attempts to measure
“the value of a human life by assimilating it to the salaries earned during a working-life”
(De Meulemeester 2007, p. 91, own translation). The idea that De Meulemeester conveys
here is that Petty is the first to study the importance of the labor force.
In his correspondence, William Petty clearly states one of his ambitions for his essays
in political arithmetic. Among other points, he declares that he intends to expose “what
the value of people are in England (...) with a method how to estimate the same, in any
other country or colony.” (Petty 1899a, p. 115). As foreshadowed by De Meulemeester,
Petty uses a mixture of national accounts and demography to calculate a per capita “value
of people”. He firstly calculates the national income as the sum of the people’s expenses,
the rent of lands and the “profit of all personal estate”. From here he deduces that:

“the Labour of the People must have supplyed (...) Twenty Six Millions, the
which multiplied by Twenty (the Mass of Mankind being worth Twenty Years
purchase as well as Land) makes Five Hundred and Twenty Millions, as the
value of the whole People: which number divided by Six Millions, makes above
8o l. Sterling1 , to be valued of each Head of Man, Woman, and Child, and of
adult Persons twice as much” (Petty 1899b, p. 267)
1

“l. Sterling”, sometimes only “l.” stands for livres Sterling.

11



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
In this specific passage, William Petty is calculating the losses suffered by England
during war. To do so, he proceeds by identifying the monetary values of each individual
who died in the conflict. He does not solely apply the results to citizens killed in combat
but generalizes this to “compute the loss we have sustained by the Plague, by the Slaughter
of Men in War, and by the sending them abroad into the Service of Foreign Princes.”
(Petty 1899b, p. 267). Proceeding as such, William Petty introduces a numeric value
to evaluate the contribution of each person to national wealth, even before the classical
economists.
This is the only reference in Petty’s writings to a clearly identified and detailed
method. In other parts, he simply states values ranging from 60 to 80 livres Sterling.
Such a result very largely foreshadows the techniques that will be developed centuries
later by scholars within the field of economics of education. Nevertheless, the method
of calculation appears arbitrary, since no justification whatsoever is provided by the author. In concordance with the delineations of this field of inquiry, as drawn by Woodhall
(Woodhall, in Psacharopoulos 1987, p. 1), Petty attempts to estimate the contribution of
labor to economic development on a national level.
The vector through which labor is a contributing factor to national wealth is not
described by Petty, he nevertheless attempts to differentiate the levels of contribution by
dividing the population into different groups. Drawing on the example of an Irish rebellion
in 16412 Petty calculates the losses to national wealth in terms of land, housing, livestock,
food, and people. He differentiates between soldiers3 , men, women, children, and slaves.
He thus indicates that “the Charge (...), Train of Artillery, and General Officers included,
cannot be less than 15 l. per Head” (Petty 1899b, p. 152) which are to be contrasted with
“Slaves and Negroes [who] are usually rated, viz. at about 15 l. one with another; Men
being sold for 25 l. and Children 5 l. each”. In another context he pursues his explanation
by declaring that “wives and children (...), sick and impotent people, idle beggars and
vagrants” whom he considers to be a “burden to the public, consuming annually so much
as would be otherwise added to the nation’s general stock.” (Petty 2003, p. 65).
As Petty provides a clear cut separation between groups of the population, he does
not provide an objective method in his proceedings. What these selected passages reveal
is wisely applied calculus to demographics. In doing so, the author is able to provide
numerical and mathematically verifiable answers to his questions of losses led by the
country due to war, epidemics or even trade of slaves. He does not provide an exploration
of the determinants that constitute the actual “value” he initially attributes to individuals.
2

This was a rebellion opposing Irish Catholics to the English government due to a feeling of oppression
and discrimination on religious grounds.
3
This is likely to be the example De Meulemeester drew his conclusions upon.

12



2.1. ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION, A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW
In this line of reasoning, Petty lacks to provide further insight into the role of education
as an economic factor. He more specifically relies on his vision of how individuals can
contribute to material production. With his reference to slaves, he estimates returns from
men to be threefold bigger than that of children. When considering women and children,
he values their production to be nonexistent. This denies the very value of both domestic
work and education.
Nevertheless, the result that this author provides – i.e. the attribution of numeric
values of contribution to national wealth – does resemble modern human capital outcomes.
As I will explore in the following subsections, human capital attempts to measure the
monetary revenue generated by education, by estimating Gross Domestic Product Per
Capita, for example. In this sense, William Petty may be viewed as an early precursor of
human capital.

2.1.2

Classic

Classical economics bring about a vision of economics of education that paved the
way for the hegemonic human capital framework. Mainly Adam Smith is commonly cited
to have initiated the study of humans as contributing to national economic development
(Sweetland 1996). Smith is very clear in the opening paragraphs of his seminal Inquiry
about the fundamental role played by men and their skills in the economic wealth of a
country.
“The annual labor of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with
all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes, and
which consist always either in the immediate produce of that labor, or in what
is purchased with that produce from other nations.” (Smith 1902, p. 39)
As such, Adam Smith foreshadows modern calculations of Gross Domestic Product.
In line with Petty, he identifies the country’s ability to produce to be the backbone of its
wealth. Moreover, Smith goes further into his inquiry into the nature of labor. Where
Petty considers it from a quantitative perspective by aggregating the values of human
beings on a national scale, Smith also considers a qualitative aspect. He states that the
ability of a nation to enrich itself relies not only on the number of people who work but also
on the “the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labor is generally applied” (Smith
1902, p. 39). This constitutes an elaboration on Petty’s mere quantitative argument by
incorporating the idea that the quantitative output of labor might differ from one person
to another, given qualitative factors.
13



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
This can be viewed as an enhancement of the informational basis from which economists
of education draw to account for the national wealth. Nevertheless, it has to be noticed
that the point of view has not shifted. Smith, as founding father of classical economics,
presages the course of his school of thought; the qualitative aspect of labor is to be considered from a macroeconomic point of view. This implies that the identification of these
non-quantitative inputs is a mere means to an end, the end being the wealth of the nation.
The individual, her or his well-being, wishes or aspirations are not mentioned nor do they
seem to have an importance in Adam Smith’s consideration.
John Stuart Mill made a large contribution to the understanding of labor to national wealth. He attempts in his Principles of political economy to formalize the notion
of productivity, finding that “many writers have been unwilling to class any labour as
productive, unless its result is palpable in some material object” (Mill 1848, p. 44). In
identifying this flaw in his predecessor’s account for national wealth, Mill opens the path
to ways of measuring national wealth which is still accurate nowadays. Forms of labor
such as housework – which have only been recently recognized as productive (Stiglitz,
Sen, and Fitoussi 2009, p. 44) – may be considered productive. Nevertheless, Mill has a
prudent stand concerning the valuation of skills:
“Thus, labour expended in the acquisition of manufacturing skill, I class as
productive, not in virtue of the skill itself, but of the manufactured products
created by the skill, and to the creation of which the labour of learning the
trade is essentially conducive. The labour of officers of government in affording
the protection which afforded in some manner or other, is indispensable to the
prosperity of industry, must be classed as productive even of material wealth,
because without it, material wealth, in anything like its present abundance,
could not exist. Such labour may be said to be productive indirectly or mediately, in opposition to the labour of the ploughman and the cotton-spinner,
which are productive immediately. They are all alike in this, that they leave
the community richer in material products than they found it; they increase,
or tend to increase, material wealth.” (Mill 1848, pp. 48–49)
Mill introduces here the importance of skills and accounts for them influencing the
material output of labor. He does maintain clearly that the skill of the artisan can only be
measured with regard to the material wealth it has allowed to produce. Therefore, when
considering a baker, he does not value the baker as the person she or he is, nor the skills
they possess, but values the bread they can make. A second aspect to be retained from
Mill’s writings is that he also introduces the importance of “indirect” productive labor.
These forms of labor may include activities previously rejected as being productive. This
14



2.1. ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION, A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW
was the case with all labor that had no direct material output which could be valued
in monetary terms. In introducing these “mediate” forms of labor, Mill opens the way
for services to be considered as profitable for society. Following his argument, one may
understand that services such as protection (e.g. the police or the army) but also education
as dispensed by teachers, is to be considered as productive. As such, services as education
can be introduced in economic analysis with its own, intrinsic value.
By introducing the importance of skills in the level of physical production Mill makes
a step towards our contemporary understanding of economics of education. This goes
along the lines that were drawn by Adam Smith, who also identified the importance
of “the skill” and of the “dexterity” with which labor is provided. The importance of
Mill’s contribution to the elaboration of the field of economics of education lies not only
in the recognition of the importance of skills. He more specifically introduces the very
importance of education itself:

“the labour being (...) employed in conferring on human beings qualities
which render them serviceable to themselves and others. To this class belongs
the labour of all concerned in education; not only schoolmasters, tutors, and
professors, but governments, so far as they aim successfully at the improvement
of the people; moralists, and clergymen, as far as productive of benefit; the
labour of physicians, as far as instrumental in preserving life and physical
or mental efficiency; of the teachers of bodily exercises, and of the various
trades, sciences, and arts, together with the labour of the learners in acquiring
them; and all labour bestowed by any persons, throughout life, in improving
the knowledge or cultivating the bodily or mental faculties of themselves or
others.” (Mill 1848, p. 136)

This passages forebodes two separate sub-domains of economics of education that
are still actively researched in the 20th and 21st centuries. First of all, he highlights that
education in itself has a market value. Identifying education as a vector to raise material
production puts it in a central position to improve national wealth. This seems to be
an enhancement of Smith’s analysis, who recognized the importance of skill but did not
discern education as a central canal to improve this latter. By linking economics and
education directly, Mill explicitly lays the foundation of modern economics of education.
As I will be exploring in the following sections, the connection between education and
economics as presented here by John Stuart Mill in 1848 is still very much explored in
modern considerations of economics of education. In other words, scholars do nowadays
still consider education as a vector to developing national wealth.
15



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
Secondly, Mill notes the importance of a physically and mentally healthy labor force.
He appears to note that ill workers lack “efficiency” and thus their production of physical
goods – which is the only virtue of labor according to this author – is decreased. This
is a very clear addition to the field of economics of education as it has been developed
by the mercantilistic and classic economists so far. Mill’s point is not that of improving
human well-being as such, since his argument lies with economic outcomes. Nevertheless,
it opens the way to a new informational basis that could lead to the identification of new
vectors to influence on the materialistic output of labor. Surprisingly, and contrary to
the first link drawn by Mill in the previous quote, this aspect of the labor force has been
neglected by inquirers in the field of economics of education. The following sections will
reveal the fascination of these scholars with the economic returns of education but will
leave aside this crucial point that Mill was able to identify more than two and a half
centuries ago.
John Stuart Mill considerably contributes to the formalization of the field of economics of education specifically by setting its goals close to those still pursued nowadays.
Moreover, his vision of the importance of a form of well-being – described by him as
“physical or mental efficiency” – is a considerable leap forward in the exploration I attempt to make in this thesis. It is still only remotely linked to the notion of well-being I
will be adopting in the following sections, but the very mention of this notion represents
a solid root to build a consolidated framework of economics of education and well-being.

2.1.3

Neoclassic

Neoclassical economics brings formalization and reformulation of previous visions of
economics of education. Alfred Marshall has greatly influenced the course of thought
on economics of education and more specifically, that on human capital. His vision of
this notion has been subject to controversy (Kiker 1966, Blandy 1967, Kiker 1968) by
expressing a “pluralistic conception of human capital” (Sweetland 1996, p. 344). This
difficulty to interpret the exact vision of this economist might be due to the evolution of
his definitions over time.
This scholar quarrel was mainly discussing whether Marshall discarded the notion of
human capital as such. Blandy brings insight by highlighting Marshall’s difficulty with
the notion of human capital, thus posing a terminological issue rather than a conceptual
one. Indeed, in the different versions of Marshall’s Principles, many passages can be
found which attempt to delineate the notion of capital. Initially confining it to material
wealth, Marshall finds it problematic to consider a human being as constituent of capital
16



2.1. ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION, A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW
as such. The following passage gives insight into the terminological issue that hindered
Marshall from a clear cut definition. This is further developed by the author himself in
the following passage, in the fifth edition of his Principles:
“We have already defined Personal wealth to consist firstly of those energies,
faculties and habits which directly contribute to making people industrially
efficient (...) if they are to be reckoned as wealth at all, they are also to be
reckoned as capital. This Personal wealth and Personal capital are convertible;
and it seems best to follow here the same course as in the case of wealth, (...) to
raise no objection to an occasional broad use of the term [capital], in which it
is explicitly stated to include Personal capital.” (Marshall, quoted by Blandy
in Blandy 1967, p. 874)
A slightly different terminology from that of modern human capital is employed. Nevertheless, the notion of an inherent capital to human beings is present in his analysis. On
the other hand, Marshall does not evoke the state of well-being of the considered individuals in any manner. In other words, his framework does not examine whether there is an
individual gain from having a higher “Personal wealth”. Marshall’s Principles introduces
another distinctive feature. In the following passage, he underlines the role of education,
thus aligning his position on that of Mill.
“The motives which induce a man to accumulate personal capital in his son’s
education, are similar to those which control his accumulation of material capital for his son. There is a continuous transition from the father who works and
waits in order that he may bequeath, to his son a rich and firmly-established
normal manufacturing or trading business, to one who works and waits in
order to support his son while he is slowly acquiring a thorough medical education, and ultimately to buy for him a lucrative practice.” (Marshall 1961,
p. 549)
In this passage, Marshall operates two main shifts in the analysis of education.
Firstly, he analyses the matter of education not solely from a macroeconomic standpoint but also introduces a microeconomic one. So far, authors who have discussed the
importance of education discussed it as a factor contributing to the total national wealth.
They valued education, not for its intrinsic value, but found it to be a contributing factor
to national wealth. Following Marshall, we find that education can also be valued on the
individual level. More specifically, he finds education to contribute to personal wealth
and thus adding to individual welfare.
17



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
Secondly, Marshall introduces the idea of the importance of legacy from parents to
their children. In doing so, he indirectly describes a major component of aspirations as
defined by psychologists centuries later. As I will discuss in the section dealing with aspirations, these latter may be composed of aspirations one has for himself, but also of those
which are projected upon him. This idea is translated by Marshall in the concept of legacy
as he describes it here. He finds that a parent may aspire to a certain standard of living
for his child, more precisely a “lucrative” one. This consolidates the idea that education
has an intrinsic and individual monetary value which may be pursued by individuals. In
projecting their aspirations for their children, Marshall finds that parents may commit to
a form of investment. This investment takes the shape of the “accumulation of personal
capital”. This idea had previously been foreshadowed by Ernst Engel (Engel 1883). He
offers a formula that is aimed to estimate the value of human beings according to what
they cost to their parents for their upbringing:

Cx = c0 (1 + x + k

x(x + 1)
)
2

(2.1)

where Cx represents the total cost for the “production” of a human being at age x, c0
stands for the cost before birth and k is the annual percentage of increase in cost.
This formalization proposed by Engel foreshadows both Marshall’s position on education, and also that of more recent Human Capital theory. In operating this formalization,
he draws a parallel between human beings - here, children - and economical investments.
In providing a cost function for the upbringing of children, Engel hints at the idea according to which education is an investment. No explicit reference made to schooling or
education in this cost function. In that perspective, it may prelude human capital, but
falls short when accounting for education.
The authors I have discussed so far are not commonly discussed with regards to
economics of education. They do present insight into understanding how the importance
of education has been progressively acknowledged by economists. Their work provides
insight as to which role may be played by education in economic growth, mainly. It is
only with Marshall that - without any specific mention - timid progress is made towards
the consideration of the importance of education on a microeconomic level. Although the
specific terms of well-being and aspirations – or any relating terms – are never employed
by these authors in the context of education and economic science, Marshall hints at an
economic role for these notions.

Human Capital; Education at its peak in Economic Science

2.2.1

The Early Days: Exogenous Growth and Production-Function
approach

Before discussing human capital and its formalization in the following subsection, it
seems important to explore the economic background against which it has been painted.
Only several years before the seminal contributions of Theodore Schultz and Garry Becker
settling human capital as the hegemonic way of considering education in economics,
economists were struggling with growth theory. These growth theories – similarly to
the previously exposed historic of considering education – did not consider education to
be an integral part of the puzzle. Education is then merely viewed as a minor contributing factor to productivity. This is the stance adopted by exogenous growth theory. In
opposition to endogenous growth theory, this corpus of literature does not consider any
contributing factors to growth beyond labor and capital. The contribution of Robert
Solow has sacred this vision in his 1956 paper (Solow 1956), cited tens of thousands of
times since then. In this paper he presents his output function as follows:

Y = F (K, L)

(2.2)

where Y stands for the single commodity output and K and L represent respectively
capital and labor.
As one may notice, there is no consideration whatsoever for any further contributing
factors to the production of Y. Taken as such, this equation will relate how much bread
a baker will be able to produce, given the monetary amount invested in ovens, and the
amount of time spent preparing and baking the bread. Whether this baker is a talented
bread-maker with a great amount of experience and knowledge about his tools or an
apprentice on his first day of work, is not relevant. To partially respond to this, Solow
introduces “Neutral Technological Change” in his model. He does so by introducing a
“kind of technological change (...) which simply multiplies the production function by an
increasing scale factor” (Solow 1956):

Y = A(t)F (K, L)
19

(2.3)



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
where Y stands for the single commodity output, K and L represent respectively capital
and labor and A(t) represents the technological change over time.
By considering technological progress as an external multiplying factor, Solow’s production function may safely be labeled an Exogenous Growth function. In this situation,
technological change only occurs from the outside and independently from capital and/or
labor. As such, education can only be represented as an outside factor influencing the productivity of the workers. This seems to be in direct contradiction with previously discussed
economists, who – despite only attributing a secondary role to educations specifically –
considered education to an inherent part in labor productivity through skills, for example.
According to Blaug (Blaug 1966), the locus classicus of what is referred to as the
Production-Function Approach was by Denison in 1962 (Denison 1962). Regarding this
new way of integrating education in economic analysis, Blaug declares that “Denison introduced education explicitly into an aggregate production-function model of the American
economy” (Blaug 1966, p. 9). Despite Denison not formulating a specific formula as Solow
did, he does decompose historical data of American growth rates and attempts to identify
its sources. In doing so he comes to the conclusion “that from 1929 to 1957 the increase
of education raised the average quality of the labor force at an average annual rate of 0.93
per cent a year.”4 (Denison 1962, p. 113). A decade later, Denison suggests a classification of sources of growth, in which he explicitly lists “formal education” (Denison 1972,
p. 21), once more confirming the direct contribution of education to national income.
These two approaches are both macroeconomic and do not consider education from
an individual standpoint. They also have in common the fact that they solely attempt
to account for the explanation of growth rates using education as an instrumental variable. Their contribution is major nevertheless; they seem to have contributed to the
acknowledgment that education has a role to play in economic analysis.

2.2.2

Human Capital and its Formalization

Human Capital has been very largely attributed to Theodore Schultz, notably by
Blaug who referred to him as “the father of the concept of human capital” (Blaug 1966,
p. 12). However, Blaug acknowledged that Gary Becker’s 1964 “Human Capital” was
“the leading theoretical work on this subject” (Blaug 1966, p. 16). In 1993, Gary Becker
edits the third version of his already seminal “Human Capital” by adding “A Special
Reference to Education” (Becker 1964). This edition occurs only one year after Becker
4

The table in which Denison decomposes the sources of American growth can be found in Appendix
A. Line 11 of this table shows Denison’s direct integration of education as a source of national income.

2.2. HUMAN CAPITAL; EDUCATION AT ITS PEAK IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
being awarded The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred
Nobel. He insists on the importance of distinguishing between traditional – i.e. physical
– capital as discussed previously and human capital. He finds that:
“it is fully keeping with the capital concept as traditionally defined to say
that expenditures on education, training, medical care etc., are investments
in capital. However, these produce human, not physical or financial, capital
because you cannot separate a person from his or her knowledge, skills, health,
or values the way it is possible to move financial and physical assets while the
owner stays put.” (Becker 1964, pp. 15–16).
In defining human capital as such, it is to be noted that Becker goes beyond “mere”
education. He opens the analysis to experience, be it as an autodidact or obtained by
training. Moreover, he makes a specific reference to the importance of the worker being
healthy. In this line of thought, human capital theory broadens the scope of considered
dimensions considerably. Despite the importance of his contribution, the previously discussed notion of human well-being – in the Benthamite sense of the term – nor the idea
of aspirations are discussed by Becker. After this promising discussion, Becker narrows
down the perspectives considerably when formalizing his analysis:

d=

n
X
j=1

kj
−C
(1 + i)j

(2.4)

where n is the number of considered periods, i is the market deprecation of human capital,
and where

k j = (Y j − X j )

(2.5)

where Yj are net revenues in period j, and Xj are opportunity costs, and where

C = Y 0 − X0

(2.6)

As such, d in equation (2.4) represents the benefits of investment in human capital for
the considered individual. This value will be negative as long as the opportunity costs
Xj – i.e. salaries that could have been received had the individual decided not to invest
in human capital – are positive. In the long run, for example when the individual has
finished her or his education, Xj will be equal to zero and Yj will substantially rise.
21



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
One critic that may be addressed to this formalization, specifically with regard to
education, is the place given to fixed costs, represented here by C. These fixed costs are
calculated as a one time cost, at period j=0. As such, this cost does not account for the
evolution of the educational system. For example, tuition fees for higher education do
not seem to be part of this equation, whereas they represent a considerable weight in the
decision of attending a university, or not.
By considering human capital according to this formalization, Gary Becker seems to
place the focus on monetary interests in human capital. The outcome, represented here
by d, is valuated in monetary terms, exclusively. Despite being aware of this, none of his
applications account for the larger scope of impact of education5 . As discussed previously,
Becker had already expressed the wider scope of analysis of human capital. Nevertheless,
this formalization appears to be more restrictive than the theorization foreshadows. He
seems to be aware of this and notes in the last edition of this seminal “Human Capital”:

“My friends in the humanities like Dick Stern may complain that so far I have
only mentioned “money”, or they might say “mere money”. Is there any place
in human capital theory for education to appreciate literature, culture and the
good life? Fortunately, nothing in the concept of human capital implies that
monetary incentives need be more important than cultural and nonmonetary
ones.” (Becker 1964, p. 21).

Despite the author expressing the possibility of human capital accounting for non-monetary
valuations, the formalization in equations (2.4) to (2.6) are specifically designed to account
for salaries and monetary costs.
Theodore Schultz provides deeper insight into the nature of human capital and how
it is to be defined:

“(a) An individual’s stock of human capital cannot be sold, nor can it be
given to someone else. It goes with the individual wherever he or she may go.
If an individual were to migrate to another country, the government cannot
confiscate that person’s human capital. Jews and other ethnic groups facing
discrimination and the danger of being expelled have known this fact for ages.
(b) To take advantage of human capital, an individual must do it in person.
5

An econometric application in his 1993 edition of “Human Capital” can be found in appendix B.
In this regression table, Becker shows the impact of years of schooling on earnings. He finds a positive
relationship between these two dimensions.

22



2.2. HUMAN CAPITAL; EDUCATION AT ITS PEAK IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
(c) The duration of the value of an individual’s human capital cannot exceed
his or her life span.
(d) In acquiring human capital the individual must invest some of his or her
own time along with other resources, for example, in acquiring an education
and the services of instructors.
(e) It is efficient to invest in human capital during the period of youth because
the value of time is less then than it is when the individual grows older and
because there will be a greater number of years in which to benefit from the
acquired human capital.
(f) Human capital depreciates over time as does physical capital. Some forms
become obsolete in a short time because of changing circumstances. Other
forms have a long life even as circumstances change. It is exceedingly important to distinguish between short and long life investments, especially so in
the case of education.
(g) Women, for good reasons, invest in somewhat different forms of human
capital than men.”
(Schultz 1987, p. 12)

In this typology, Schultz enhances Becker’s delineation of human capital by not only
making this form of capital human – in opposition to physical or financial capital – but
he also makes it an exclusively personal form of capital. In other words, Schultz finds
that this form of capital cannot be alienated from its owner (points a to c). He also finds
that human capital cannot be acquired as one would acquire a machine by simply buying
it; according to him, time is a prerequisite to obtaining this form of capital. He specifies
this may apply particularly to education, and cannot be acquired as the Wachowski (at
the time) brothers imagined it in The Matrix film trilogy, by uploading knowledge to a
human brain. Furthermore, he identifies the necessity of “other resources”; these might
very well refer to the monetary ones like tuition fees, omitted in Becker’s formalization
(point d). Schultz finds the importance to make these investments in human capital during
young age, following many other economists in point (e) (see for example Heckman 2009,
Heckman 2012). On the other hand, Schultz reinforces Becker’s equations (equations (2.4)
to (2.6)) when referring in his point (f) to the depreciation of human capital over time.
As mentioned previously, this is translated through the introduction of factor i.
The line of thought of Gary Becker when calculating rates of return to education
is furthermore developed by George Psacharopoulos, bringing human capital to an institutional level. As head of education research at the World Bank from 1981 to 1998,
he adopted this approach as the leading theory to analyze education and effects on productivity as well as its return to private investment. His contribution to making human
23



CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
capital theory a hegemonic approach to education lies probably in the fact that he published over 500 papers and books during his scholar activity. His impact goes so far as to
have a paper dedicated to analyzing his legacy within economics of education, while still
active as a scholar (Jimenez and Patrinos 2003). Along the lines of Becker’s analysis of
rates of return to education, Psacharopoulos finds that “private returns are higher than
‘social’ returns” and that “overall, the average rate of return to another year of schooling
is 10%” (Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2004, p. 112) when considering 98 countries6 .
A distinction is made between the private and the social return to education by
Psacharolopoulos in appendix C. So far, with Becker and Schultz notably, I have only
discussed the impact of private returns to education. Throughout the more recent studies
on human capital, many authors differentiate between these two types of returns. The
social returns are considered many fold with analyses accounting for effects of education on
crime (see for example Lochner and Moretti 2004) on citizenship (see for example Milligan,
Moretti, and Oreopoulos 2004) and on health (see for example Currie and Moretti 2003).
With these studies and many alike, education is found to impact society as a whole on a
larger scale than productivity and an increase in salaries.

2.2.3

Further developments in Economics of Education

Despite this considerable evolution of the role of education in economic science,
economists still fail to recognize the intrinsic value of education. This can be illustrated by the “fascination with screening” that Klees evokes in 1991 (Klees 1991, p. 722).
This screening hypothesis, also called the filter hypothesis (Arrow 1973), is rooted in
the progressive acceptance of imperfect information on economic markets. Specifically,
an employer has virtually no way to know which skills applicant exactly posses. In its
early shapes, human capital theory accounted for worker’s skills with years of schooling
or diplomas. The screening hypothesis argues that a diploma does not account for all
the skills of the applying worker, but acts merely as a screen. The employer uses the
diploma to filter candidates to hire, hoping that their diplomas will proxy their skills.
The screening hypothesis, therefore, questions the idea that schooling has an impact on
skills and therefore productivity. This line of thought has destabilized the hegemonic
position of human capital theory through formalization (see for example, Spence 1974
and Stiglitz 1975, among others). Blaug declares that the “implications of the screening
hypothesis [make] the empirical status of human capital theory seem much less secure.”
(Blaug 1989, p. 334). Despite this strong imperfection in the formulation of human capital

2.2. HUMAN CAPITAL; EDUCATION AT ITS PEAK IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
theory, many mainstream economists fail to acknowledge it, and few to no attempts are
made to address it (Klees 1991).
As such, when De Meulemeester wonders in the title of his article “Does Economics
of Education Progress?” (De Meulemeester 2007, own translation) and with regards
to the exploration that I just proposed, a skeptical answer seems to be in order. It is
remarkable how scholars in the field of economics of education have been discussing the
same notions since the 17th century. This can be attributed to a larger hegemonic set-up
of economic science. With specific reference to education and after an in-depth analysis of
the historic literature on human capital theory, Klees finds that “neoclassical economics
refuses to consider seriously the destructive consequences of its own criticisms.” (Klees
1991, p. 731). These criticism include notably the screening hypothesis in economics of
education and the lack to consider other social sciences.
The conclusion drawn by Klees in 1991 is made with special reference to economics of
education, focusing on human capital theory and should be put in perspective. In parallel,
research has been conducted on non-monetary benefits of education which “represent positive impacts on utility which are not captured by traditional economic measures.” (Vila
2000, p. 28). This line of research has many ramifications and attempts to highlight the
impacts of education which are not traditionally measured in the neoclassical approach to
education. In his paper, Villa identifies multiple dimensions which are positively impacted
by increased education levels:
(a) Health benefits
(b) Fertility benefits
(c) Benefits for children
(d) Occupational benefits
(e) Benefits related to consumption and savings
(f) Distributive benefits
(g) Stability of social structures
Previously to Villa, a paper from 1984 by Haveman and Wolfe already highlighted
the importance of non-market effects of education 7 . These authors – among many others
– show that the scope of analysis of economics of education is not as narrow as Klees put
it in 1991. Nevertheless, this vast literature is rarely called upon in the more traditional,
neoclassical approach, of economics of education. The gist of this exploration can be
captured in Klees’s milder phrasing when he says:
“If education yields increased satisfaction from listening to music or a better

The table that synthesizes the literature in Haveman and Wolfe 1984 can be found in appendix D.

CHAPTER 2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
functioning democracy provides many with diffuse benefits, these outcomes are
as integral a part of understanding the efficiency of education as the increased
ability to produce automobiles.”
(Klees 1991, p. 728)

Following the “traditional” economics of education, and even the more recent research
previously discussed, it can be noted that education has been regarded solely as an input.
As such, it has only been treated as a means to an end. This is illustrated by human
capital theory, but also the later research which attempts to identify a larger scope of
impact of education on society. In this sense, one must conclude that economics does
not view education as a standalone end to achieve. Moreover, explicit research on the
impact of education on individual well-being or ties with aspirations is non-existent in
the literature discussed so far. This conclusion is to be put into perspective with more
recent work undertaken by economists who broaden their field of analysis to other social
sciences.
This standpoint is adopted by James Heckman and several of his co-authors, starting
mainly in the early 2000s. Their focus is not solely on pure economics but attempts to
draw on psychology and sociology to expand the understanding of education. This allows
these authors to consider education as a vector for far-reaching ends, such as physical
and mental health8 . These dimensions are not new as such to the economic analysis of
education, as discussed previously. One entirely new aspect that has been introduced
by Heckman nevertheless, lies in the taking into account of non-cognitive skill formation.
The cognitive skills are the only ones that have been discussed so far and translate in the
increase in the individual’s ability to be more productive, for example. When considering
the screening hypothesis specifically, the employer screens individuals for cognitive skills
which provide him with greater productivity. Following Heckman, taking into account the
non-cognitive skills could permit to overcome the issue posed by the screening hypothesis.

8

An example of this can be found in appendix E. This specific illustration of Heckman’s work shows
how education influences hourly wage, employment, and regular exercise positively and obesity poor
health, depression and daily smoking negatively.

he compound name well-being contains the gerundive of be and wel, a term from the
early 17th century. It then has a meaning similar to the understanding we have of
the word ‘well’ nowadays; ‘in a satisfactory manner’. It also appears across north-western
Europe, in languages such as Saxon (wela), Norse (vel ), Frisian (wel ), Dutch (wel ) and
High German (wela), with a Proto-Germanic root signifying ‘abundancy’. This first
interpretation will remind an economist of neo-classical theory in which the individual
will gain more utility from consuming more goods. When we rephrase this, we may say
the consumer gains more well-being from abundancy. On the other hand, the ProtoIndo-European root wel slightly diverges, meaning something along the lines of ‘to wish’.
We may, therefore, without any claim to scientificity, draw a parallel with the notion
of aspiration. It appears that, etymologically, well-being may be understood as a state
of being one would aspire to. This also reminds Kant’s conception of aspirations being
oriented to well-being. I further develop the philosophical aspects of happiness in another
subsection to deepen our understanding of this complex notion. We may nevertheless

already note that on top of orientating all aspirations, happiness also is “the supreme
good” according to this philosopher. Very close to economic terminology, this epigraph
should have given content for economists to reflect upon.
This chapter will start by exploring the place of well-being and the different historical
interpretations this term has had in economic science over time. The second section will
then discuss the issue of measurement, which has been one of the major issues related
to the notion of well-being in economics. Finally, I will discuss the developments of the
notion of well-being in other social sciences.

3.1

Well-Being and Economics

This section will discuss the place of well-being in economic science. It is to be
noted that this concept has many aliases when studied by economists. For instance, wellbeing, happiness and utility are often used interchangeably in the literature dealing with
economics of well-being. Moreover, ‘economics of well-being’ may also be referred to as
‘welfare economics’ or alternatively ‘welfarism’. More recently, authors have also referred
to this as the “economics of happiness” (Graham 2005, Sen 2008, Davoine 2012). I will
attempt here to differentiate between the conceptualizations of well-being in economic
theory over time.
The subsections reflect the major phases in the evolution of economic thought on
well-being. The first subsection is a retrospective into the origins of welfare economics
and it’s evolution. I will explore authors ranging from Jeremy Bentham to Amartya Sen
by following the constant changing concept of well-being. The second subsection will then
deal with the specifics of social choice theory. The final subsection will explore economics
of happiness, mainly identifiable by the large diffusion of alternative methods.

3.1.1

Welfare Economics

Without ever knowing it, most undergraduates in economics study the very foundations of welfare economics. Many standard textbooks in microeconomics deal with
the notion of utility as a proxy for well-being. These students are told that measuring
the well-being of economic agents is quite impossible as such, while the lecturer rapidly
flies over the measurement issues scholars have encountered over time. The conclusion
roughly remains the same; the well-being of an individual cannot be measured directly
and the adopted solution is to proxy well-being with revealed preferences, thus consump28



3.1. WELL-BEING AND ECONOMICS
tion. Without further explanation or justification, solely for simpler modelization, the
conditions of pure and perfect competition are announced. Major textbooks do not go
any further in this consideration, either merely stating the use of the proxy (Picard 1990,
Malinvaud 1982), or shifting entirely the focus (Varian 2015). Indeed, Varian states that
utility was previously used as a proxy for well-being whereas it has to be considered a
synonym for preferences. A similar change in the focus of analysis can also be found in the
standard textbook by Krugman and Wells (Krugman and Wells 2016) who proxy utility
to a measure of satisfaction. The observation of a shift in textbooks - moving away from
welfare economics - since the 1960s has been made in Atkinson 2001.
This vision of rigorous mathematical precision as a response to an issue of human
complexity eclipses the long history of welfare economics. It fails to account for the intellectual struggle to find an appropriate translation of well-being in economics. It is to
be noted that several of the mathematical tools used nowadays in courses in microeconomics were not available to those who pioneered the economics of welfare (Warke 2000).
It seems therefore in order to understand the aims of welfare economics, rather than
focusing exclusively on the tools to achieve these goals.
In retrospect, welfare economics has considerably transformed the notion of utility
over time. Jeremy Bentham’s writings are commonly admitted to be the starting point
of welfare economics and will initiate what is now called the Old Welfare Economics. He
argues that the “fundamental axiom” of utilitarianism is “the greatest happiness of the
greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong” (Bentham 1891, p. 93). The
choice of terminology is a good indicator of Bentham’s aim. Throughout his work, he
uses the terms of happiness and utility - which will only later become the mainstream
economical denomination - interchangeably. This relates the hedonistic nature of his
analysis which he details in a famously quoted passage from his Principles of Morals and
Legislation:

“To a person considered by himself, the value of a pleasure or pain considered
by itself, will be greater or less, according to the four following circumstances:
1. Its intensity.
2. Its duration.
3. Its certainty or uncertainty.
4. Its propinquity or remoteness.”
(Bentham 1879, p. 29)

Following this specification, Bentham ventures in the fifth chapter of his Principles in
the classification of mutually exclusive kinds of pleasures and pains. His aim is therefore
29



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
a genuine inquiry into the nature of happiness of human beings with an attempt to
understand how economic science can contribute to its understanding and bettering. This
approach greatly differs from mainstream modern economics. As I have foreshadowed
previously, the modern focus in welfare economics is rather on the measurement and the
tools which seem most fit to do so. The debate on the aim of this field of economic inquiry
is scarce in modern literature on the subject.
The hedonistic nature of what we now call “Old” Welfare Economics is reaffirmed by
Arthur Cecil Pigou, who does not only consider the happiness of individuals but affirms
that “for a full treatment we should need to bring into account also such dissatisfactions
or disutilities as men may suffer” (Pigou 1951, p. 289).
It is notable that as Bentham explores the constituent elements of human happiness,
he makes not only an economic inquiry but a multidimensional one, based on philosophy
and psychology. This analysis moves in the opposite direction of modern welfare economic
analysis. As I will discuss further on, mainstream economics has taken the path of simplifying the reality through debatable hypotheses with a model as the aimed endpoint.
The scholars working on these models are aware of them being reductive with regard to
the reality they attempt to account for. In this sense, the chosen path of analysis is that
of fitting the data with the ad hoc models instead of deriving the models from – observed
– reality.
This previous specification of the determinants of the “value” of human happiness
can be generalized according to Bentham when adding another circumstance, being the
“extent” of the considered pain or pleasure. This extent relates the “number of persons
(...) who are affected by it” (Bentham 1879, p. 30) and translates the moral position
adopted by the author. This is indeed the endpoint of Bentham’s policy recommendations; the policy-maker should orient legislation as to maximize the “greatest happiness
of the greatest number”. This argument implies that (i) the considered individual has
the ability to give a numerical valuation of her or his state of happiness, and (ii) the
legislator has the ability to somehow compare happiness between individuals. These two
fundamental assumptions characterize Old Welfare Economics. Once again, Pigou – as a
major representative of this school of thought – has explicitly defended them.
Regarding (ii) the assumption of the possibility of interpersonal comparison of utilities, Pigou states that “on the basis of analogy, observation and intercourse, interpersonal
comparisons can, as I think, properly be made” (Pigou 1951, p. 292).
When taking into account the greatest happiness of the greatest number principle,
Bentham can be interpreted as in favor of wealth redistribution policies. Such a position

30



3.1. WELL-BEING AND ECONOMICS
is highly criticized by later scholars, who find it to be morally charged and expressing an
ethical standpoint. These two critics are referred to as the (i) cardinality issue and (ii)
the issue of interpersonal comparisons of utility.
This critic has been summarized by Hotelling who affirms that “the general wellbeing would be purchased at the expense of sacrifices by some; and that it is unjust
that some should gain at the expense of others, even when the gain is large and the cost
small” (Hotelling 1938, p. 258). Despite these critics, Tom Warke argues – based upon
in-depth textual analysis – that Bentham was aware of the issue of constructing a morally
uncharged social welfare function (Warke 2000). He cites Bentham in stating that:

“ ‘Tis in vain to talk of adding quantities which after the addition will continue
distinct as they were before, one man’s happiness will never be another man’s
happiness . . . [[This addibility of the happiness of different subjects, however,
when considered rigorously, it may appear fictitious, is a postulatum without
the allowance of which all political reasoning is at a stand]]” (Bentham 1972,
p. 495)

Bentham acknowledged the difficulty to infer his analysis from a micro- to a macroeconomic level. This aspect of his analysis has for a long time been misinterpreted by
analysts (Warke 2000). Nevertheless, this does not offer a solution as to how objective
policies should emerge from his greatest happiness of the greatest number principle. Moreover, the ability to measure an individual’s happiness - the cardinality issue - remains a
flaw in Bentham’s analysis, as I will discuss in the section concerning the measurement
of well-being. These issues have been addressed in the late 1930’s, in what is now called
New Welfare Economics.
The illustration of Pigou’s aim when writing his seminal The Economics of Welfare,
he refers to this discipline as “instruments for the bettering of human life” (Pigou 1927,
p. vii). Pigou’s intentions – evidently in line with those of Bentham – are those of finding
policies that could contribute directly to people’s well-being. His aim is therefore close to
that of Bentham and his principle of the “greatest happiness of the greatest numbers”. It
is to be noted that both Bentham and Pigou are labeled economists, but they nevertheless
use very diverse terminology. Aiming for “happiness” and “bettering of human life”, these
scholars use a variety of concepts which do not (anymore) seem to be used in mainstream
21st century economics. Or at least, these wordings of an economical issue will disappear
with the decline of the ‘Old’ Welfare Economics, not to be seen again before the rise of
the Capability Approach as outlined by Amartya Sen, many decades later. This idea has
been conveyed by Atkinson when he labels one of his talks “The Strange Disappearance
31



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
of Welfare Economics”(Atkinson 2001).
On a more rigorous tone, Scitovksy points at the criticisms addressed to the initial line
of thought on Welfare Economics, i.e. the issues of interpersonal comparison of utilities
and cardinality. Despite Bentham and Pigou’s noble intentions of bettering human lives,
their line of thought did not withstand the epistemological criticism it suffered in the early
1930’s. This criticism was led by Bergson and Samuelson. The 1938 paper by Bergson is
often considered to have sealed the faith of Old Welfare Economics (Bergson 1938). Old
Welfare Economics have been found “naive” and “unable to withstand the methodological
criticism of the Pareto School” (Harsanyi 1955, p. 309). The methodological criticism that
Harsanyi refers to, relies on the two main critics addressed to the former line of thought
in Welfare Economics.
‘New’ Welfare economists claim it to be impossible to measure well-being directly.
This undermines the previously developed notion of cardinality. To oppose this thought,
these scholars introduce the notion of ordinal well-being. Ordinal well-being implies that
an individual can not say that an apple provides them with 5 units of well-being and
an orange with only 3 units. The ordinal approach to well-being says that individuals
can only rank their preferences, in other words, they can say that they prefer apples to
oranges. This example is trivial and most people can relate to it by effectively ordering
their preferences for one fruit or another. The resolution of the issue of cardinality has
led scholars to rapidly adopt this new approach. This ordinal approach may present
difficulties in more complex situations nevertheless, but as Warke puts it “whether wellordered preferences are congruent with reality has not been of major concern” (Warke
2000, p. 25).
The second major issue ‘New’ Welfare Economics attempt to tackle is that of interpersonal comparability of utilities. In other words, these scholars argue that one cannot
compare the utilities two distinct individuals derive from an identical apple. This complicates the construction of a social welfare function since the policy-maker cannot simply
sum all the individual states of well-being to determine the social welfare function. The
further impact on research and policies is considerable; it means that a large share of
ethical considerations is withdrawn from the analysis. This change is a major contributor
to the becoming of Welfare Economics as a positive branch of economics, where it used
to be a normative one.
The analysis adopted by ‘New’ Welfare Economics is narrowed down to identifying
individual sets of preferences. This shift in the analysis completely discards the necessity
to measure well-being as such and replaces it with the observation of an agent’s behavior.
As such – and following Scitovsky – it is to be noted that welfare economics as such
32



3.1. WELL-BEING AND ECONOMICS
cease to exist at this stage. Indeed, the focus of this branch of economics is shifted from
well-being – or ‘happiness’ in the Benthamite tradition – to the study of preferences.
More specifically, revealed preferences; if given a revenue, an agent can buy either x or
y, and decides to buy x, economists following this analysis will conclude to a revealed
preference of x over y. The underlying assumption is that of perfect rationality of the
observed economic agent. This is clearly expressed by Little who assumes that “if an
individual’s behaviour is consistent, then it must be possible to explain that behaviour
without reference to anything other than behaviour.”(Little 1949, p. 97).
Instead of attempting to obtain the greatest happiness for the greatest number, the
focus is now shifted to what is called allocative efficiency. This optimization problem
has been addressed by Vilfredo Pareto, who has given his name to the famous notion of
Pareto Optimality. His resolution of this problem is to state that a social or economic
policy, reallocation or trade should only take place if at least one individual is better off
without making any other individual worse off. This reasoning requires nevertheless a
strong assumption expressed by Alfred Marshall: “it would naturally be assumed that
a shilling’s worth of gratification to one Englishman might be taken as equivalent with
a shilling’s worth to another . . . until cause to the contrary were shown” (Marshall
1961, p. 108). The implications of such an assumption are very strong. Going back to
apples and oranges, Pareto would find the situation in which all the apples and oranges
in an economy were in the hands of a single individual “optimal”. In a fictional economy
that is only composed of apples and oranges - no other goods or services are available for
trade or consumption - Pareto Optimality would require no trades to take place. Indeed,
if our fruit-opulent individual were to proceed to any kind of trade, he would lose a small
portion of his capital. Despite other individuals having something to eat, Pareto would
argue that our fruit-magnate would be “worse off”, and thus recommend no trades took
place.
Even in the early stages of the development of this vision, critics have pointed out
the impoverishment of the analysis. Scitovsky objected that once the hypothesis of noninterpersonal utility comparisons and the law of diminishing marginal utility (implying
that people derive that same satisfaction of an extra monetary unit of income) had been
adopted in economic analysis, “welfare economics ceased to exist at this stage.” (Scitovsky
1951, p. 305). He points evidently to what I have tried to highlight through the historical
analysis of the evolution of welfare economics. Despite the fact that we still talk about
‘welfare’, the focus has completely shifted. Where Bentham attempts to identify sources
of pleasures and pains, while attempting to integrate them into the economic analysis,
‘New’ Welfare Economics have drifted away from this objective. These scholars now focus
solely on the revealed preferences, eliminating well-being from the equation entirely. In

33



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
this line of thought, Cooter and Rappoport highlight the importance to “balance the gains
in understanding markets which the ordinalist framework facilitated against the losses in
understanding human welfare” (Cooter and Rappoport 1984, p. 528).
Kotaro Suzumura sums up three major epistemological critics to ‘New’ Welfare Economics, which support the abandonment of the initial notion of well-being in welfare
economics:

“(a) it fails to capture the original Pigovian idea of discovering feasible instruments for improving human life
(b) it presupposes that a social welfare function is given from outside of economics (...)
(c) if we try to tackle the social choice theoretic investigation into the process
or rule to mold social welfare function from individual values, it opens the
Pandora’s box of the Arrovian general impossibility theorems.”
(Suzumura 2016, p. 12)

3.1.2

Social Choice Theory; rethinking Welfare Economics

Social Choice Theory is defined by Kotaro Suzumura as “concerned with the evaluation of alternative methods of collective decision-making, as well as with the logical
foundations of welfare economics.” (Suzumura 2002, p. 7). The first part of this definition of Social Choice Theory - that of collective decision-making - is commonly traced
back to the French Marie-Jean Condorcet and Jean-Charles Borda. The late eighteenth
century in which these two authors wrote has later been called “the first golden age of social choice” (McLean 1995). These scholars were mainly concerned with election schemes.
Their focus has never been anywhere near maximization of social welfare, but rather in
finding a rigorous logical foundation for democratic elections.
Having abandoned cardinality and interpersonal comparisons of utility, economists
are left with almost purely positive economic analysis. No ethically charged propositions
had to be made; the scope of analysis of the economist was that of a neutral observant.
The sole remaining normative statement was that provided by Pareto and his notion of
optimal welfare. This was later enhanced by Bergson who advocated for a maximum
welfare function. Further improvements were made by John Hicks and Nicholas Kaldor
who proposed what is referred to as a Kaldor-Hicks efficiency criterion. The commonly
identified issue of these welfare improvement propositions is that they failed to properly
aggregate the individualistic nature of the New Welfare analysis.
34



3.1. WELL-BEING AND ECONOMICS
Social Choice Theory takes up this challenge of finding a consistent way to aggregate
the microeconomic analysis proposed by Welfare Economics. The starting point of this
line of thought is commonly attributed to the seminal writings of Kenneth Arrow, more
specifically when he demonstrates his famous Impossibility Theorem, which is formally
called the Possibility Theorem (Arrow 1950). In the later and more “cleaned-up version”
(Sen 1985b, p. 1766) of this theorem, Arrow reasons upon four conditions:

1. (i) “Unrestricted domain” or “universality”: the social welfare function
must be defined for all possible individual sets of preferences.
2. (ii) “Pareto Principle”: if x is preferred to y by all individuals, than x is
socially preferred to y.
3. (ii) “Independence of irrelevant alternatives”: the societal choice of a set
of alternatives must be independent of the existence of other alternatives.
4. (iv) “Non-dictatorship”: no individual in the considered society must be
able to impose their preference as the social preference.

Given a finite set of individuals and a minimum of three separate social states, Arrow
shows that there is no social welfare function that satisfies the four previously exposed
conditions.
Social choice theorists have in this sense attempted to overcome the issue of aggregation as exposed in New Welfare Economics. To do so, scholars have either dropped
hypotheses or changed the focus of the analysis. The theoretical corpus that was born
from Arrow’s Possibility Theorem and that this thesis will mainly focus on is Amartya
Sen’s capability approach. The capability approach as developed by Sen may be viewed
as a continuum of welfare economics insofar as it adopts similar strategies to resolve the
previously exposed issues. More specifically, Sen proposes a radical change in focus by
trading ordered preferences as studied by mainstream economics for capabilities. The notion of capabilities and the approach in its entirety will be further discussed in chapter 5.
Sen justifies such a shift in focus when he declared that “it would be hard to believe that
welfare economics could flourish without going into these neighboring disciplines [moral
philosophy] as well, and Arrow’s analysis has made the interconnections a lot clearer.”
(Sen 1985b, p. 1766).
35



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING

3.1.3

Economics of Happiness

The capability approach is not the only resolution proposed by economists to solve
the issues found in the reasoning of mainstream economics of well-being. Notably the socalled “economics of happiness” have proposed a return to subjective well-being, initially
discarded by neoclassical schools of thought. Economics of happiness may be defined
as an “approach to assessing welfare which combines the techniques typically used by
economists with those more commonly used by psychologists. It relies on surveys of
the reported well-being (...)” (Graham 2005, p. 41). As such, the theoretical corpus of
economics of happiness introduces and generalizes the usage of subjective well-being in
economic analysis.
Not only do economics of happiness address Arrow’s Possibility Theorem, but according to Frey and Stutzer 2002 it also allows to address the so-called Easterlin Paradox
as formulated by Richard Easterlin (Easterlin 1974). Despite being considered as a major
result, only a few economists pursued the line of research that Easterlin opened in the
1970s with his now seminal paper. Authors have found different explanations as to why
this shift in interest did not occur at the publication of this paper. When discussing the
revealed preference approach, Sen finds that “the popularity of this view in economics
may be due to a mixture of an obsessive concern with observability and a peculiar belief
that choice (...) is the only human aspect that can be observed.” (Sen 1987a, p. 12). Once
again, “its dominance is reflected in the contents of microeconomics textbooks” (Frey and
Stutzer 2002, p. 404). Furthermore, Frey and Stutzer find that the subjective approach
allows a “fruitful complementary” approach to well-being.
Mainstream welfarists have displayed great reluctance to the usage of survey data to
identify well-being for individuals. This is mainly due to the inherent bias of subjective
data which does not respond to the claims of scientificity some economists envy in natural
sciences. These biases are mainly due to unobserved factors that economists can not control for, including for example the mood of the respondent, the formulation of the survey
questions or even dishonest responses. This reluctance to use such data can be viewed as
a major difference between the methods of economists and other social sciences (Bertrand
and Mullainathan 2001). Despite this, economics of happiness allows accounting for the
Easterlin Paradox by including a larger span of determinants of happiness. Many studies
have identified the variety of these determinants such as for example emotions (Elster
1998), unemployment (Clark and Oswald 1994), or sexual activity (Blanchflower and
Oswald 2004).

3.2

Measuring Well-Being

The origins of the fundamental axioms in welfare economics have brought forth a
dispute. Many authors find the first occurrence of welfarism in the writings of Adam Smith
and his metaphor of the invisible hand. This belief has been more recently dismantled
and re-attributed to Jeremy Bentham’s writings, as I have discussed previously (Blaug
2007).
The first subsection will attempt to retrace measurements proposed to measure utility
as defined in Old and New Welfare Economics. The second subsection will then further
develop more recent measurements as proposed by economics of happiness, namely subjective well-being.

3.2.1

Utility

I have discussed previously that a consensus is still standing on the idea that utility
can not be directly measured. This inability gave way to the parting from “Old” Welfare
Economics and the occurrence of the “New” Welfare Economics. Nevertheless, scholars
have proposed the idea that utility could be measured directly. This can, once again,
be traced back to Bentham. In section 3.1.1, we quoted from his “Principles of Morals
and Legislation” where he defines dimensions of pleasure and pain. Once these defined
and expanded when applied to a group of people, Bentham proceeds to “take an exact
account (...) of the general tendency of any act, by which the interests of a community are
affected”. This formulation is not without reminding the idea of a social welfare function,
also previously discussed.
Bentham then exposes a rigorous method on how to calculate precisely which actions
are beneficial, or not, to a community. This method is now called the “hedonistic calculus”
or the “felicific calculus”, and can be found in appendix F. This attempt to measure social
welfare seems to lack the crucial phase of actually measuring the utility within individuals.
As such, the hedonistic calculus can be considered rather as a method of dealing with
numeric utilities once they have been measured.
Other authors have attempted to tackle the issue of measuring utilities within individuals directly. The most prominent example being that of Edgeworth who proposed
the idea of a hedonimeter. In the context of great popularity “psychophysics” in the field
of psychology, Edgeworth imagined “an ideally perfect instrument, a psychophysical machine, continually registering the height of pleasure experienced by an individual, exactly
37



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
according to the verdict of consciousness” (Edgeworth 1881, p. 101). Edgeworth imagined
this machine as being capable of measuring the “flutter of the passions”. When he proceeds to describe the actual functioning of such an apparatus, it is not with reminding us
of a seismograph. He imagined it to register utility within an individual by “photographic
or other frictionless apparatus upon a uniformly moving vertical plane.” Similarly to the
seismograph, Edgeworth indicated that the machine would measure the “quantity of happiness between two epochs [as] represented by the area contained between the zero-line,
perpendiculars thereto at the points corresponding to the epochs, and the curve traced
by the index” (Edgeworth 1881, p. 101). Despite Edgeworth’s efforts to imagine such an
artifact, it has never been operationalized in his lifetime. I will further discuss advances
in this field in section 3.2.2.
Old welfare economics refer to cardinal and interpersonally comparable utilities. Measurement of such utilities may be very straight forward, while posing major measurement
issues. Intuitively, a researcher could simply ask the subject to give a numerical value to
each element that is to be measured. Let us consider the example of apples, oranges, and
pears and let imagine that the subject is asked to numerically value the utility she would
draw from consuming each of them on a given scale from 0 to 10. The outcomes would be
relatively simple, where the subject would gain, for example, 4 utility from apples, 6 from
oranges and 7 from pears. This becomes infinitely more complex when considering more
complex sets, such as for example all the fruits that exist. The subject would spend a
considerable amount of time valuing the fruits, might not have tasted some of them or not
recall doing so. With the occurrence of computers and the increasing power of software,
more elaborate strategies to measure utility cardinally have been developed. Namely,
the MACBETH approach has been discussed throughout the 1990s. The “Measuring
Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation TecHnique” is an “approach conceived
to aid a person D to elaborate cardinal value judgements about elements of a finite set
A, and to associate a real number µ(x) with each element x of A” (Costa and Vansnick
1994, p. 489). These authors then attempt to reduce the number of questions (which
were initially necessary to have the subject compare between all the different existent
types of fruit) by measuring ratios between elements rather than the individual elements
themselves:
“∀ x,y,w,z ∈ A with D judging x more attractive than y, and w more attractive than
z, the ratio

[µ(x) − µ(y)]/[µ(w) − µ(z)]

38

(3.1)



3.2. MEASURING WELL-BEING
reflects the ratio (that D feels with greater or lesser precision) of the differences of attractiveness between x and y on the one hand, and w and z on the other hand” (Costa and
Vansnick 1994, p. 489).
The authors acknowledge throughout their paper that the questioning method “is
quite hard for D” and that “it is not reasonable to ask D for a numerical estimate of
the ratio of the differences of attractiveness that he feels between x and y on the one
hand and w and z on the other hand.” (Costa and Vansnick 1994, pp. 489–490). Despite
their efforts in simplifying the questioning techniques and proposing solutions to reduce
its complexity, this method has received a limited amount of interest.
Before the development of the MACBETH method, which requires a certain amount
of computational power, discussions evolved mainly around the theoretical bases of the
welfare. I have discussed this in previous sections. Kotaro Suzumura synthesizes some of
the discussions which were held in Betham and Pigou’s conception of welfare in a simple
framework:
“Design an institutional framework of the economy so as to identify and implement a
solution x* ∈ S to the following constrained maximization problem

M ax {u1 (x) + u2 (x) + ... + un (x)} over all x ∈ S

(3.2)

where S is the set of feasible social alternatives, ui is the utility function of person i ∈ N
:= {1, 2, . . . , n} with 2 ≤ n <+∞” (Suzumura 2016, p. 5).
Furthermore, and also along the lines of the debate discussed previously, Suzumura
proposes a formalization for the criticisms addressed to the “Bentham-Pigou” formulation.
These criticisms will result in the New Welfare Economics and may be described formally
as:
“Design an institutional framework of the economy so as to identify and implement a
solution x* ∈ S to the following constrained maximization problem

M ax f (u1 (x) + u2 (x) + ... + un (x)) over all x ∈ S

(3.3)

where S is the set of feasible social alternatives, f is the Bergson-Samuelson social welfare
function that maps the profile u(x) = (u1 (x), u2 (x), . . . , un (x)) of individual utilities on
x ∈ S into an ordinal index of social welfare” (Suzumura 2016, pp. 8–9).

39



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
Upon looking closer to these two formalizations, it is notable that equation 3.3 encapsulates equation 3.2. The distinction lies in the function f that is applied in equation 3.3;
as such, equation 3.2 is the social sum total of individual utilities sum whereas equation
3.3 is the ordinal index of social welfare provided by a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare
function. I have discussed the theoretical foundations for these measurements in previous
sections, which entail interpersonally comparable cardinal utilities for equation 3.2 and
interpersonally non-comparable ordinal utilities for the latter equation 3.3. Suzumura
summarizes the progression from the former to the latter maximization program can be
considered as a “quantum leap in the history of welfare economics” (Suzumura 2016, p. 9).
Despite these synthetic programs, their actual measurement remains problematic.
This is notably due to the nature of both u and S. More precisely, u refers to all the
utility functions of the studied individuals. The precise identification of u may entail a
considerable amount of determining factors, of which most are arguably omitted in economics. Moreover, u is hypothesized to be unique and thus identical for all the considered
individuals. This is a very strong hypothesis and excludes de facto individuals with special
needs. Such a presumption can be questioned furthermore for every individual, as I will
discuss in section 5.1.1, where Amartya Sen will argue that utility gained from a similar
element is unlikely to be identical between a cripple and a pleasure-wizard. Furthermore,
S refers to “the set of feasible social alternatives”, which may be very complex situations.
Every single one of these situations is complex enough to pose an evaluation issue in itself,
let alone the evaluation of multiple situations.

3.2.2

Subjective Well-Being

As I have discussed throughout the previous sections, terms such as “happiness”,
“well-being” and the derivative “utility” do not have a universally accepted meaning
(Hirschauer, Lehberger, and Musshoff 2015). This is especially true when considering
social sciences in the broad sense, as will be done in section 3.3. “Because happiness is
such an elusive concept, it makes little sense to proceed by trying to define what happiness
is. Fortunately, there is a useful way out. Instead of trying to determine what happiness
is from outside, one can ask the individuals how happy they feel themselves to be.” (Frey
and Stutzer 2002, p. 4). This workaround of the measurement issue of utility gives way to
subjective well-being. In other words, it allows to bypass the issue of direct – be it cardinal
or ordinal – measurement, by entrusting the evaluation of well-being to the individual to
whom the measurement is applied.
With the advent of experimental psychology and behavioral economics, ideas similar
40



3.2. MEASURING WELL-BEING

Figure 1: The operationalization of Edgeworth’s ‘hedonimeter’ in the lab (Hirschauer,
Lehberger, and Musshoff 2015, p. 14)

to that of Edgeworth’s hedonimeter have been tested in both laboratory environments and
in situ. In line with subjective well-being, and acknowledging the – so far – impossibility
to measure directly states and scales of well-being within an individual, Kahneman and
his colleagues imagined experimental protocols to measure them subjectively. Using the
hypothetical hedonimeter, happiness would be the temporal integral over the instant
happiness function. Instead of using an apparatus, Kahneman proposed to identify the
instant happiness function by asking people to draw this function themselves: “They are
asked to provide a continuous indication of the hedonic quality of their experience in real
time by manipulating a lever that controls a marker on a scale, which is usually defined
by extreme values such as very pleasant and very unpleasant and by a neutral value”
(Kahneman and Krueger 2006, p. 5). A visual representation of this type of measurement
has been proposed by Hirschauer and his co-authors in figure 1.
This conception of measuring happiness has been labeled “instant happiness” (Hirschauer,
Lehberger, and Musshoff 2015, p. 14) or “experienced utility” (Kahneman and Krueger
2006, p. 5). It refers therefore to the measurement of spontaneous moments of happiness which are evaluated in situ. In contrast, they defined “remembered happiness” and
lastly the “construction of an overall well-being judgment”. The latter two can be distinguished from the first as they do not attempt to measure happiness at one specific instant,
rather they demand the individual to whom the measurement is applied to reflect on past
episodes and to evaluate their levels of happiness ex post and in a laboratory setting.
Remembered happiness – also referred to as “remembered utility” (Kahneman and
Krueger 2006, p. 5) or “hedonic level” (Veenhoven 2015, p. 4) – can be translated into
the day-reconstruction method. This method has been used by researchers to measure
41



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
happiness a posteriori. Individuals are invited to reflect on the activities they undertook
during the day and to associate their levels of happiness to each of these undertakings.
This makes this method more reflexive and adds new subjective dimensions to the obtained
measurement. Each of the measurements will be weighted averages, and thus change from
the previously discussed temporal integral method. Three impacts which would change,
positively and/or negatively, the experienced utility in this method have been identified;
(i) the duration of episodes of pleasure and displeasure has a disproportionately low
weight, (ii) disproportionately high weights are placed on positive and negative peaks
and finally (iii) the relative weight of the experience increases towards the end of the
period under consideration (adapted from Kahneman and Krueger 2006 and Hirschauer,
Lehberger, and Musshoff 2015). When considering these points, it is to be noted that they
are highly correlated with the theoretical understanding Bentham proposed of happiness
(see section 3.1.1). As such, dimension (i) can be assimilated to Bentham’s point 2. of
“duration”, dimension (ii) may refer to Bentham’s point 1. of “intensity” and the last
dimension (iii) can be translated as the “remoteness” Bentham describes. Pursuing this
assimilation, it seems that Bentham’s third point has been omitted by these authors when
they fail to identify the “certainty” dimension.
The construction of an overall well-being judgment is a method that requires the
highest degree of introspection on behalf of the individual from which happiness measurements are taken. Labeled as “contentment” by Veenhoven, he details that “most human
evaluations are based on both sources of information, that is: intuitive affective appraisal
and cognitively guided evaluation” (Veenhoven 2015, p. 9). As such this author posits
that this method represents a good synthesis of the two previously discussed ones. Both
the spontaneous occurrence and the retrospectively analyzed moments of (dis)pleasure are
thus taken into account. This method can be translated into a measurement that utilizes
a Likert scale to questions that attempt to evaluate happiness over a global time span. It
is, therefore, following these authors, among others, that the survey for this thesis will be
constructed.
Following the incorporation of a cognitive evaluation in this latter method, Hirschauer
and his co-authors posit that one component of the measurement of happiness relates to
the “individual’s perception of to which degree his/her aspirations are being (and are likely
to be) realized” (Hirschauer, Lehberger, and Musshoff 2015, p. 15). When reformulating
this component, one may call it the “certainty” component. As such, by adding this last
dimension, it is remarkable that this method aligns perfectly with Bentham’s dimensions
to happiness.

3.3. SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES ON WELL-BEING

3.3

Social Sciences and Humanities on Well-Being

Research on well-being is evidently not limited solely to economics. This is particularly true since the focus of current mainstream economics has deviated its attention
from the study of well-being to the study of utility. In the words of several economists,
economical science has even completely ceased to take interest in the notion of well-being
as such (Scitovsky 1951, Atkinson 2001), focussing solely on their new appellation, whilst
populating it with a meaning solely pertinent for its operationalization in economic science. Furthermore, by coining this new term, economics has isolated itself from other
social sciences as well as the humanities.
This section aims to discuss well-being both from the perspectives of philosophy
(subsection 3.3.1) and from psychology (subsection 3.3.2).

3.3.1

Philosophical Well-Being

The debate around what exactly well-being – or happiness – entails is as old as
documented western philosophy. Nevertheless, there exists no consensus as to its exact
definition, eudaimonism and hedonism are not entirely conciliated. The specific terminology used is representative of this debate. Happiness is the most usual translation for
eudaimonia from Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics whereas “in contemporary usage, the
term happiness is generally considered to refer to hedonic happiness” (Waterman 1993,
p. 678). Moreover, eudaimonia may be translated from the original ancient Greek as
welfare, sometimesflourishing, and sometimes as well-being” (Kraut 2018). On the other
hand, hedonism can be viewed as a philosophical positioning that argues that “a good
life should be a pleasurable life” (Veenhoven 2003, p. 437).
In the epigraph of this chapter, Immanuel Kant refers to happiness as the “supreme
good”, from which we may derive that the object of inquiry is a universal objective.
Furthermore, he limits happiness to “rational beings” and thus, to human beings. Kant
more specifically defines happiness as “the satisfaction of all our desires, extensively, in
regard to their manifoldness, intensively, in regard to their degree, and protensively, in
regard to their duration” (Kant 1922, p. 647). This definition appears very close to the
one given by Bentham in his Principles of Morals and Legislation, where he provides
among others intensity and duration as defining elements. In light of these observations,
hedonism and eudaimonia can also be distinguished according to them. Where hedonism
is argued to provide more intense, shorter bursts of happiness, eudaimonia is a more
long-lived and arguably less acute form of happiness.
43



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING
Bentham’s conception of welfare has often been depicted as hedonistic as it puts
on the foreground the notion of pleasures and attempts to reduce pains. As touched
upon previously, the philosophical – or at least, the conceptual – foundations of welfare
economics as developed after Bentham’s disavowal are hard to grasp as they change
entirely the object to utility through revealed preferences. By focusing merely on a very
concise aspect of well-being, economists have created a self-sufficient framework, that
aims to study human beings for what economists allow them to be theoretically, rather
than for what they are. Nevertheless, utility is derived from the individual’s revealed
preferences. These revealed preferences are expressed through explicit and measurable
choices made by the studied individual. As such, they are proxied by consumption, for
example. When considering consumption in the philosophical understanding of well-being,
one can intuitively understand such a proxy as purely hedonistic. It aims at satisfying
short-lived pleasures rather than happiness in its entirety. Finally, I will argue that
the introduction of the capability approach allows for a wider understanding of human
happiness within economic science, by solidly anchoring it in philosophical eudaimonia.
Etymologically, eudaimonia comes from the Greek eu, which means “good” and
daimon (or daemon), which means “spirit”. Following this, Alan Waterman considers
that “the daimon refers to those potentialities of each person, the realization of which
represents the greatest fulfillment in living of which each is capable. These include both
the potentialities that are shared by all humans by virtue of our common specieshood and
those unique potentials that distinguish each individual from all others.” (Waterman 1993,
p. 678). Despite a different terminology, Waterman’s understanding of the daimon is a
conceptual neighbor to Amartya Sen’s idea of capabilities. Waterman defines potentialities
as something inherent to an individual and that the latter can realize, where Sen defines
capabilities as something an individual can do or be. Furthermore, Waterman notices that
potentialities can be unique to a specific individual, but can also be found in multiple –
if not all – human beings. Similarly, Martha Nussbaum has established a list of 10 core
capabilities that ought to be inherent to all humans, while other capabilities might be
very individual-specific.
With regards to well-being, Richard Ryan and Edward Deci find that “well-being
is not so much an outcome or end state as it is a process of fulfilling or realizing one’s
daimon or true nature—that is, of fulfilling one’s virtuous potentials and living as one
was inherently intended to live” (Deci and Ryan 2008, p. 2). This interpretation of the
daimon embodies the conversion process between capabilities and achieved functionings –
more specifically, the element of choice – and explains it as a source of well-being. Finally,
Elizabeth Telfer defines eudaimonia as having “what is worth desiring and worth having
in life” (Telfer 1980, p. 37). This is not without reminding of Sen’s formula defining

44



3.3. SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES ON WELL-BEING
capabilities as being “doings and beings an individual has reason to value”. I will further
discuss the specifics of the capability approach in section 5.1.

3.3.2

Well-Being and Psychology

The increasing interest in subjective well-being “reflects larger societal trends concerning the value of the individual, the importance of subjective views in evaluating life,
and the recognition that well-being necessarily includes positive elements that transcend
economic prosperity.” (Diener et al. 1999, p. 276).
It has been argued by psychologists that the theory of the happy life or happiness has
not advanced since ancient Greek Philosophers (Wilson 1967, Diener et al. 1999). I have
discussed previously the writings of Kant and Bentham who do explore and define this
notion. Nevertheless, one may understand these psychologist’s claims as referring to their
field of inquiry. Within the boundaries of psychology, these authors define the happy life
according to two postulates which state that (i) “the prompt satisfaction of needs causes
happiness, while the persistence of unfulfilled needs causes unhappiness.” and (ii) “the
degree of fulfillment required to produce satisfaction depends on adaption or aspiration
level, which is influenced by past experience, comparisons with others, personal values,
and other factors.” (Wilson 1967, p. 302).
These principles can be viewed in the light of Kant’s interpretation of happiness.
Where Wilson refers to “needs”, Kant prefers “desires”. And while Wilson identifies in
(i) the rapidity with which a need is fulfilled and in (ii) the degree of fulfillment, Kant
defines the amount, the intensity and the duration of the fulfillment of desires. In other
words, these interpretations can be viewed as privileging time and completeness of desire
fulfillment. The time component indicates that it is important to respond to a need
or desire rapidly, but also to preserve the fulfillment over time. On the other hand,
the completeness component highlights the importance of fulfilling all of an individual’s
needs, as well as fulfilling them individually as much as possible. It is to be noted that
this division is consistent with Bentham’s analysis of human happiness as I discussed
in section 3.1.1. His “circumstances” 1 and 3 could thus be considered as part of the
completeness component and 2 and 4 integrate the time component.
This theoretical background, and with specific reference to the completeness component, shows that happiness is a multidimensional notion by nature. In other words, one
would be unable to identify a single element that can account for the global happiness of
an individual. This goes against the previously discussed economist’s vision. In section
3.1.1, I pointed out that mainstream economics proxies happiness, or well-being, with the
45



CHAPTER 3. WELL-BEING

Figure 2: Components of Subjective Well-Being (Diener et al. 1999, p. 277)
notion of utility. In turn, this notion is uni-dimensional and often reduced to monetary
income, consumption or capital of the considered individual. Psychology and philosophy
allow enhancing the understanding of happiness for social scientists in general. This intuition is confirmed by what economists refer to as the Easterlin Paradox. Mere money
cannot account solely for individual well-being. The phenomenon highlighted in 1973 by
Easterlin, is confirmed in a similar observation made by psychologists decades later. This
observation can be found in appendix G.
Despite this ‘paradox’ for economists, a rigidity to change in dimensions can be
noted. On the other hand, psychologists have attempted to identify other dimensions to
happiness, with regard to the completeness component which I highlighted previously. In
this line of thought, Wilson asserts that “the happy person emerges as a young, healthy,
well-educated, well-paid, extroverted, optimistic, worry-free, religious, married person
with high self-esteem, high job morale, modest aspirations, of either sex and of a wide
range of intelligence.” (Wilson 1967, p. 294). These demographic correlates of subjective
well-being are identified empirically through questionnaires by Wilson. On a theoretical
level, Diener, Suh, Lucas, and Smith resume their correlates of subjective well-being in
figure 2.
With regard to both philosophy and psychology, subjective well-being is an informational basis that is increasingly documented and acknowledged. I will anchor an entire
section in my empirical application on subjective well-being by integrating relating questions in the questionnaire. The construction and analysis of this questionnaire will be
further discussed in the last part.

Chapter 4
Aspirations
All hoping is directed towards
happiness.
Kant 1922, p. 647

tymologically the word aspiration can be traced back to the early 15th century to
the old French aspirer. Among other possible definitions, there could be ‘to endeavor’,
‘to obtain’ or ‘to seek to reach’ and sometimes even ‘to climb up to’. All these notions
and possible interpretations give interesting insight as to what aspirations may entail.
The idea of wanting something and longing for it is an initial element in this etymology.
One may understand also that an effort is required in order to obtain what is wanted.
This would be very consistent with the idea that education may impact the aspirations
of an individual. In other words, considering education as an effort, or an investment in
economic terms, this effort may enhance or decrease an individuals’ ability to formulate
and the possibility of realizing her or his aspirations.

Economics and Aspirations

The discussion relating ‘mainstream’ economics and the concept of aspirations is
relatively scarce. One has to delve deeper into specific branches of economics to find
pertinent literature exploring this notion. It is mainly in behavioral economics and more
recently in development economics that the concept of aspirations is explored as such. To
include aspirations in the ‘mainstream’ economic analysis implies tensions between the
traditional hypotheses applied to economic agents. This is grasped in the early stages of
47



CHAPTER 4. ASPIRATIONS
its development by behavioral economists:

“Traditional economic theory is built on an idealization of man. (...) This idealization has advantages. Strong assumptions usually lead to strong conclusions. However, it is difficult to bridge the gap between the rational economic
man and the groping, unstable man whom the behavioral scientist knows.”
(Starbuck 1963, p. 128)

Considering aspirations from an economic standpoint is therefore not a simple exercise
and major modifications have to be implemented in traditional theory for aspirations to
‘fit’.
In this section, I will draw upon economics to explore the notion of aspirations. More
precisely, I will try to explore how economists have progressively attempted to integrate
this complex notion into their existing models. The second subsection will then attempt
to explore the factors which determine aspirations. Mere economics will not suffice to
do so, which is why I will draw upon anthropology, sociology, and psychology. These
social sciences will permit better insight into a notion in which complexity cannot solely
be grasped by “mainstream” economics. Finally, I will attempt to tie the notion of
aspirations to those of education and well-being. This last subsection will, therefore,
draw upon the previous sections.

4.1.1

Economics and Aspirations, a story of rationality

As stated before, there are very few to no pertinent references in mainstream economic
literature to aspirations. Economics indeed requires extensions to other social sciences
- i.e. psychology, sociology or anthropology - to integrate this notion. When Herbert
Simon wonders “how much psychology does economics need?”, he responds with a very
illustrative metaphor:

“Suppose we were pouring some viscous liquid-molasses-into a bowl of very
irregular shape. What would we need in order to make a theory of the form
the molasses would take in the bowl? How much would we have to know about
the properties of molasses to predict its behavior under the circumstances? If
the bowl were held motionless, and if we wanted only to predict behavior in
equilibrium, we would have to know little, indeed, about molasses.” (Simon
1959, p. 255)
48



4.1. ECONOMICS AND ASPIRATIONS
Simon illustrates human behavior with the adaptation of the molasses to the shape
of the bowl. The shape of the bowl, kept motionless in this first instance, represents
the economic environment in which the human evolves. This first part of his metaphor
represents traditional, mainstream economics, which excludes any reference to other social
science and utilizes strong hypotheses on both the actors, i.e. human beings, and the
economic environment. He transcribes the idea that very little information is needed
about the humans to predict their behavior. This is a perfect representation of the homo
œconomicus; only very little is known about this actor, yet, his behavior is perfectly
predictable. The homo œconomicus indeed only requires to be utility maximizing and
perfectly rational in doing so.

“If (...) new forces (...) were brought to bear on the liquid, we would have to
know still more about it even to predict behavior in equilibrium. (...) Similarly,
in an organism having a multiplicity of goals, or afflicted with some kind of
internal goal conflict, behavior could be predicted only from information about
the relative strengths of the several goals and the ways in which the adaptive
processes responded to them.” (Simon 1959, p. 255)

The second configuration of the metaphor alleviates the strong hypotheses symbolized
in the first configuration by the motionlessness on the one hand. On the other hand, the
transformation of the homo œconomicus in an organism having a multiplicity of goals
instead of aimless molasses. Simon shows that in this case, prediction requires more
information about the molasses itself indeed. In other words, when operating a shift from
(neo-)classical analysis of the economic agent in a static fishbowl to that of a human being
in a dynamic economic environment, one has to dive into the complexities of this very
human being.
This shift is operated with insight from psychology in the late 1950s and the early
1960s. These allow for a better understanding of decision-making progress in economic
situations (Simon 1959). Notably, economic science contradicts major findings in psychology. This is translated into the concept of satiation, which is rejected entirely in
(neo-)classical mainstream economics. A rational agent cannot be satiated; whatever the
amount of water the individual has drunk, another glass will provide this agent with a
supplementary amount of utility. Economists have introduced the notion of diminishing
marginal returns to indicate that every new glass of water will provide a smaller amount
of utility than the previous one, but it will still provide some. Always. This leads to an
evident incoherence where an economist will recommend drinking more and more water,
leading unavoidably to hyponatremia.
49



CHAPTER 4. ASPIRATIONS
The contradiction with psychology lies in the fact that the latter considers actions
not from a maximization standpoint, but rather from the fulfilling of drives. Once the
drive is satisfied, it will cease to exist as such and the individual will stop the undertaken
action destined to fulfill the drive. Simon described this distinction as the fact that the
“economic man is a satisficing animal whose problem solving is based on search activity
to meet certain aspiration levels rather than a maximizing animal whose problem solving
involves finding the best alternatives in terms of specified criteria” (Simon 1959, p. 277).
As such, psychology certainly has a contribution to make to economic analysis, especially in the bettering of economist’s understanding of the homo oeconomicus. The
integration of these elements has translated in economics by the development of theories of “bounded rationality”. One application of bounded rationality is the Aspirations
Adaptation Theory and was developed in the early stages by Reinhard Selten. For his
work, he was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel in 1994 alongside John Harsanyi and John Forbes Nash. Nevertheless, the
focus was on the development of game theory and the intriguing Nash, and Aspirations
Adaptation Theory only received a limited interest.
Almost two decades after the “Simon-Selten hypothesis” (Schwartz 2008), Richard
Easterlin notes several direct applications for the concept of aspirations. This notion is
still fragile at that time in economic literature, notably due to a lack of empirical support. Easterlin introduces aspirations as a complementary factor of analysis for behavior,
alongside physical goods, when he declares that “behavior is influenced by the interplay
between aspiration and the resources people have to satisfy their aspirations” (Easterlin
1976, p. 417). His application of the notion of aspirations is made specifically to fertility rates. He finds that if the gap between actual resources detained by a household
and its aspirations is too considerable, this household will be reluctant to have children.
This slightly shifts the focus from a purely ‘resource-based’ analysis to the assessment of
simultaneously detained resources and introduces aspirations as a new explanatory factor.
Easterlin finds aspirations to also constitute an element of explanation of his famous
“Easterlin Paradox”. This paradox shows that when the Gross Domestic Product per
capita increases, the overall happiness of the population does not increase. As I have
discussed previously, this finding was a major disavow of welfare economics. The paradox
occurs where money could measure an agent’s well-being through the actual spending of it.
As a response to his own paradox, Easterlin poses this rhetorical question: “[suppose that]
material aspirations are a product of one’s economic socialization experience, and growth
in real income expands the material environment, as it necessarily must. Then, over the
long run, may not aspirations advance at the same pace as real income, negating the
welfare improvement expected to follow from income growth?” (Easterlin 1976, p. 420).
50



4.1. ECONOMICS AND ASPIRATIONS
As such, Easterlin proposes the concept of aspirations to contribute to understanding why
an increase in happiness does not occur when income increases. It also highlights, once
more, the importance of the acceptance that the homo oeconomicus modelized as such
does not account for the variety and the diversity of economic agents and their actual
levels of well-being. This standpoint is confirmed in further empirical (Stutzer 2004) and
theoretical (Frey and Stutzer 2002) explorations.
The notion of a “gap”, foreshadowed by Easterlin, is used several decades later by
Debraj Ray. The idea Ray conveys is similar to that exposed by Easterlin, mainly due
to the fact that the example he takes to illustrate his idea is that of material aspirations.
He finds that “the aspirations gap is simply the difference between the standard of living
that’s aspired to and the standard of living that one already has. I want to argue that
it’s this gap—not aspirations per se, nor one’s standard of living per se — that affects
future-oriented behavior.” (Ray 2006, p. 3). Moreover, Ray gives a formalization of his
understanding of aspirations following the equation:

g(a, s) ≡ max

a−s
,0
a

(4.1)

where a stands for the aspired to standard of living and s the current standard of living.
It is to be noted that both the equation and Ray’s explanation refer to standards of living,
and thus, to material well-being. This is only “for concreteness” and it is to be noted
that “the same idea can be applied, perhaps with modification, to other dimensions” (Ray
2006, p. 3).
This formalization emphasizes the notion of the aspirations gap. The importance is
not the aspirations as such, but the distance from what an individual aspires to and what
she or he currently possesses. This can be in terms of material capital, but can also be
social or intellectual among others.

4.1.2

Social Determinants of Aspirations

So far, in the first subsection, I have explored aspirations from an economist’s point
of view. The question of determinants of these aspirations has not been asked so far.
This may be due to this question not being pertinent from a (neo-) classical economist’s
perspective; aspirations are formed by a perfectly rational homo oeconomicus. The formation of the aspirations of this agent is therefore perfectly rational in the same way and
requires only to maximize his utility. Any other input would not be deemed relevant nor
51



CHAPTER 4. ASPIRATIONS
rational and thus, would be discarded.
In 1968, Archibald Haller explores a terminological issue which may shed initial
light on the matter of the determinants of aspirations. He makes a distinction between
“aspirations” and “expectations”. According to him, the first “can serve well to describe
ego’s own orientation to a goal” (Haller 1968, p. 484). On the other hand, expectations
refer rather to “hopeful anticipation for the other”. The anticipation from one individual
for another can also have a direct impact on the second individual’s aspirations. A
simple illustration is that of a parent who has high educational expectations for her or
his child. These parental expectations can in turn influence the child’s aspirations. Such
an understanding of aspirations foreshadows the findings of the capability approach on
aspirations, as will be discussed further in section 4.2.
The idea of social influences on the formation of aspirations is not a recent one. It
has been highlighted in 1939 by Kurt Lewin who finds that “the level of aspiration is
greatly influenced by such social facts as the presence or absence of other persons or by
the competitive or noncompetitive character of the situation.” (Lewin 1939, p. 869).
The seminal work by Ray introduces the notion of “aspiration window” and attempts
to identify the individuals who might influence a person’s aspirations. He argues that
aspirations are formed through observation of those individuals within one’s aspiration
window. The aspiration window is not constituted solely by peers, but also includes
individuals who are close, spatially, economically or even socially. Moreover, an aspiration
window can be populated by role models, people one can relate to (Ray 2006). This vision
broadens the pool from which an individual can draw her or his aspirations since it does
not limit it to the sole social group of peers to which this individual belongs. When
taking into account the exponential development of social media and similar platforms
of discussion, individuals have a constantly increasing range of opportunities to relate to
others and thus widen their aspiration window.

Aspirations Connect the Dots; Foreshadowing the
Capability Approach

Economics meet the Capability Approach

The previous developments of aspirations starkly contrast with the manner they are
applied ‘traditionally’ in economics, as discussed throughout the previous chapters, in
52



4.2. ASPIRATIONS CONNECT THE DOTS; FORESHADOWING THE
CAPABILITY APPROACH
which studies almost systematically fail to consider aspirations altogether. More recent
studies do progressively integrate a more comprehensive understanding of aspirations,
notably drawing on Appadurai and Ray. As such, Bernard et al. 2014 find that in “economic terms” aspirations may be thought of as “bounds among individuals’ preferences,
the elements of the choice sets which they consider as relevant for them and motivate
their actions” (Bernard et al. 2014, p. 2). Without an explicit reference to the capability
approach, this definition presents a vocable that appears particularly close to the definition Amartya Sen provides for capabilities. The progressive translation of the notion of
aspirations into economic science provides solid anchoring for the direction of the overall
direction of this thesis.
Furthermore, the specific understanding of aspirations provided by Bernard et al.
2014 allows to further justify the importance of the inquiry of this research. They identify
three salient features of aspirations (adapted from Bernard et al. 2014, p. 4):
1. Aspirations express goals or goal-orientations (or desired future end-states) that are
relevant to well-being.
2. Aspirations evolve over time in response to life experience and circumstances.
3. Aspirations are an important influence on behavior (or actions) and thus attainment
or outcomes.
Following these economists, strong relations to the capability approach and its understanding of future-orientated capabilities can be identified. Moreover, they find the
existence of a link between aspirations and well-being. The fulfillment of aspirations provides higher levels of future well-being. Conversely, Wilson illustrates the opposite relation
when he declares that “high aspiration is therefore seen as a major threat to happiness”
(Wilson 1967, p. 302). Too high aspirations present a higher risk of non-fulfillment, thus
directly threatening future well-being outcomes. Secondly, they highlight the evolving nature of aspirations as a direct result of “experience” and “circumstances”. Such a finding
is highly consistent with the dynamic nature of capabilities as further discussed in section
6.1.3. Finally, and most importantly for the direction of this thesis, aspirations influence
are found “important” with regards to “attainment or outcomes”.
The latter feature of aspirations is crucial for the theoretical development I propose
here. Indeed, the main argument presented is that the scope of education within economic
science is too narrow and fails to correctly capture educational outcomes. This is due to
the short-sighted approach proposed by human capital theory particularly. In considering
the main outcome of education to be higher productivity, which in turn results in higher
income, it fails to account for aspirations. As presented by these authors, aspirations
53



CHAPTER 4. ASPIRATIONS
constitute an important factor in outcomes. As such, the argument that is made here
(and which will be empirically supported in Part III) is that aspirations are to be considered if educational outcomes are to be fully understood. Following these authors, the
integration of aspirations in the understanding of (economic) outcomes allows for a better
account of education globally. Furthermore, the link between aspirations and well-being
is also rarely considered in economic science. Highlighting this link will furthermore allow
understanding the role aspirations may play in the educational context.

4.2.2

Educational Aspirations

When referring back to the seminal work by Gary Becker on human capital, the sole
aspiration that is derived from education is that of a higher salary. Findings in different
academic fields provide a more comprehensive understanding of aspirations globally, and
even more so with specific consideration of the educational context. As discussed in the
previous section, economic science has nevertheless progressively started to integrate a
more widespread understanding of aspirations in its analysis. In the educational context
this is translated in studies like Page, Garboua, and Montmarquette 2007 and Beaman
et al. 2012. Drawing on experimental economics they find that aspirations may result in
higher educational attainment. This constitutes the core of the rationale that this thesis
attempts to address, with the difference that it draws on the informational basis of the
capability approach as defined by Amartya Sen rather than pure economics.
The notion of aspirations has also been discussed in the light of the capability approach specifically. A considerable amount of research on this subject – with specific
reference to educational context, or not – has been led by Caroline Hart (Hart 2011a,
Hart 2011b, Hart 2012, Hart 2016). The link between education and aspirations has
also been further highlighted through agency, see for example DeJaeghere 2018. Further
research has highlighted the links between aspirations and well-being, see for example
Ibrahim 2011.
Hart finds that when applied to children, and in line with the results from the previous
section, external influences play a major role in the shaping of aspirations. As such, her
field research shows that “while sometimes individuals may develop aspirations of their
own volition in other cases they are persuaded towards particular aspirations by others.
(...) there was evidence of some teachers guiding students towards or away from certain
aspirations. There were also instances where an individual’s aspirations conflicted with
the wishes of significant others, and parents in particular.” (Hart 2012, p. 84). Children
appear therefore to be particularly exposed to external influences on their own aspirations.
54



4.2. ASPIRATIONS CONNECT THE DOTS; FORESHADOWING THE
CAPABILITY APPROACH
This has led me to integrate a specific measure for the external influences on aspirations
in the questionnaire (module 8) that is further developed in Part III. These external
influences are also consistent with literature on dynamic and evolving capabilities.
Beyond the external influences on aspirations, specifically, when considering younger
individuals, internal factors are also to be taken into account. Hart identifies multiple
internal registers which influence the formation of aspirations (Hart 2011b). Drawing
on a large scale field study, she finds that “pathways are informed by emotional as well
as pragmatic choices” (Hart 2011b, p. 4). The emotional aspect of aspiration formation
relates the stage where an individual projects herself into the future and wonders how she
would feel if that specific aspiration were to be realized. With regard to economic theory,
the impact of emotions on rationality has also been progressively explored. The findings
of Hart are therefore consistent with those explored by for example Erev et al. 2002,
who explore the impact of emotions within the framework of bounded rationality. This
emotional register is complemented by the “performance and cognitive” register. In this
case, the individual attempts to identify whether she will have the ability to achieve the
considered aspiration. Finally, to further the previous discussions provided by Lewin and
Ray, Hart introduces the “socio-cultural register”. This register is not the be interpreted
as Ray’s “aspiration window”, but shifts the focus to the feeling of belonging, rather than
the belonging itself. In this case, the individual ponders whether she will feel that she
will “fit in”.
Agency in the shaping of aspirations plays a predominant role. The empirical application applied at the end of this thesis will find strong evidence pointing in that direction.
The impact of agency on the formation of aspirations has also been approached on a
theoretical level. Figure 3 illustrates the link between aspirations and agency.

CHAPTER 4. ASPIRATIONS
Figure 3 shows the identification of four different types of aspirations in a threedimensional space. The types of aspirations range from independent aspirations to conflicting aspirations and are consequently assimilated with a decreasing degree of agency.
Independent aspirations may be qualified as aspirations that are formed autonomously by
the considered individual. Shared aspirations are aspirations that result from a process
of “negotiation” between the aspiring individual and significant others, such as parents
or teachers. Guided aspirations are aspirations that come from a process in which the
aspiring individual is oriented towards a specific (set of) aspiration(s) and did not have
a high autonomy of decision. Finally, conflicting aspirations are those aspirations help
by an individual that directly clash with the aspirations significant others project on
this individual. Within the second dimension, these aspirations also vary accordingly to
the importance of aspirations to the observed individual or their significant others. This
tends to show that aspirations are formed or destroyed according to a ‘weight’ which is
attributed to these aspirations by the individual and by the people who constitute this
individual’s social sphere. Finally, and in the third dimension, time is found to “change”
aspirations. As the individual evolves, and specifically children, her or his aspirations
evolve accordingly. This has been discussed in the literature on children and aspirations,
for example, Biggeri et al. 2006 and Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim 2011. This finding is
confirmed in the exploratory empirical application proposed at the end of this thesis.
As such, Hart finds that aspirations are determined by an “overall impact on an
individual of a constellation of factors” (Hart 2011b, p. 19). This specification allowed
for a more informed construction as developed in Part III and permits the integration of
informed questions that attempt to measure the influencing factors identified here. This
will prove to be successful as agency comes is found to be the most significant factor
impacting the formation of aspirations. The role of education in the capability approach
will be more generally review in section 6.2.

he Capability Approach as developed by Amartya Sen operates a major shift in the
informational basis when compared to the previously discussed theoretical and empirical frameworks. In the previous chapters, I discussed economic, sociological and psychological schools of thought and their approach in tackling the questions of education,
well-being, and aspirations. The shift operated by Sen’s approach allows considering all
these dimensions in one single theoretical framework. Amartya Sen’s background as an
economist, specifically that of development economics and social choice theory (which led
him to the 1998 Nobel Price in Economics) as well as a philosopher, opens the way for an
extended and an inclusive informational base from which stems his capability approach.

CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
The first section will attempt to define more precisely the rationale of the capability
approach.

5.1

Core of the Capability Approach

The advent of the capability approach’s rationale can be traced back to Sen’s lectures
in the late 1970’s and his writings which stemmed from there. It has since then been
widely discussed, critiqued, specified and reformulated by scholars from various academic
backgrounds. In his Tanner Lectures on Human Values, Amartya Sen asks the question
“Equality of What?” while considering utilitarian equality, total utility equality and
Rawlsian equality (Sen 1980). I have discussed the notion of utility in previous sections
(see sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1). The first subsection will, therefore, discuss the rationale
of the capability approach. It will specifically consider this approach from a welfarist
economic standpoint. This is done with reference to the well-being problematique as
coined by Des Gasper (Gasper 2007). Secondly, I will further discuss the notions of
capabilities and functionings

5.1.1

Rationale of the Capability Approach

Sen’s Tanner Lectures on Human Values argue that approaches that consider individual utility - as the previously discussed forms of utility and happiness - may not be
sufficient. He argues that this specific form of outcome relies too heavily on a variety of
factors that the analysis does not include, such as personality, aspirations but also the
ability to benefit from marginal utility. He states that “if person A as a cripple gets half
the utility that the pleasure-wizard person B does from any given level of income, then
in the pure distribution problem between A and B the utilitarian would end up giving
the pleasure-wizard B more income than the cripple A” (Sen 1980, p. 203). In a second
stance, he argues against the more general case of the welfarist approach to well-being.
He finds here that this approach “ignores claims arising from the intensity of one’s needs”
and that no attention is given to ”the number of people whose interests are overridden in
the pursuit of the interests of the worst off” (Sen 1980, pp. 208–209).
Instead of these approaches, which I have previously discussed, Sen promotes what
he then calls “basic capability equality”. He adds, on a humorous note which reveals his
intimate conviction that he “shall not desist from doing some propaganda on its behalf”
(Sen 1980, p. 197). His Tanner Lecture takes place at the dawn of his capability approach,

5.1. CORE OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH

Figure 4: The well-being puzzle triangle: inputs and outcomes (Gasper 2007, p. 338)
and the outline he provides has since been updated, notably by himself. He defines basic
capabilities initially as “being able to do certain basic things”. This first definition omits
a major domain which Sen later added when he redefined capability as “the alternative
combinations of functionings the person can achieve, and from which he or she can choose
one collection. The approach is based on a view of living as a combination of various
‘doings and beings’, with the quality of life to be assessed in terms of the capability to
achieve valuable functionings.” (Sen 1993, p. 31). This latter formulation of ‘doings and
beings’ will be adopted by a major part of the scholars studying the capability approach.
Des Gasper examines the rationale of the capability approach as an addition to the
standard economic analysis of well-being. He brings a better understanding through the
study of the inputs and the outputs which are considered in different social sciences1 .
The illustration attached to his analysis is that of the ‘well-being puzzle triangle’ in
figure 4. This triangle represents the relationships that exist between economic inputs,
represented by income, objective well-being and subjective well-being. It is to be noted
that there are no arrows on the sides of the triangle due to ‘patchy’ relationships between
these dimensions. Several arguments are mobilized by Gasper to justify this statement.
He draws on ‘economics orthodoxy’ (Gasper 2005, p. 182 to represent the link between
well-being outcomes and economical income. Following this literature, this correlation is
positive, as well-being increases with income. But this consideration goes only as far as
the Easterlin Paradox, as I discussed previously in section 3.1.3. This figure then also
accounts for other inputs on the well-being outcomes which may include every aspect of

Figure 5: Sen’s addition of attention to potential outcomes (Gasper 2007, p. 338)

human lives that contribute to the shaping of one’s well-being but the economic inputs.
However, the origin, the nature and the impact of the ‘other inputs’ remain unexplained
in this first figure and fail to take into account adaptive preferences and framing effects,
for example.
In the capabilitarian vocable, figure 4 represents actual functionings. Sen’s contribution to this analysis is that of adding a layer of analysis, which becomes the core of this
approach. As can be seen in figure 5, the central notion is that of ‘positive freedoms’.
These freedoms also gave their name to the entire approach, being labeled ‘capabilities’.
The introduction of freedoms in the analysis allows rethinking the previous illustration.
The first distinction to be made is the fact that the economic inputs do not directly influence well-being in this second representation. The dotted line that links the economic
inputs to subjective well-being represents solely the idea that an individual may experience higher levels of well-being exclusively due to the possession of more money (a higher
income, for example). In more general terms the economic inputs are here only a means
to achieve higher levels of well-being.
62



5.1. CORE OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
The second layer of analysis – i.e. the positive freedoms – are determined by the ‘other
inputs’ and the previously discussed economic inputs. These freedoms, in turn, influence
the well-being outcomes, rather than the economic inputs as in the first representation.
This shifts the analysis of the well-being problematique entirely; without denying the
importance of economic inputs, the capability approach considers a supplementary step.
The richness of the capability approach lies specifically in the study of these positive
freedoms. Where utilitarian approaches find a direct link between income – or material
wealth – and well-being, the capability approach posits the existence of positive freedoms
as a translation of this economic wealth into actual well-being. I will further develop
the understanding of positive freedoms in sub-section 5.1.2. As such, the capabilities of
an individual can increase with higher economic inputs. Nevertheless, the translation of
these higher capabilities into well-being are conditioned on other factors. These conversion
factors are visible in figure 6.
It is also important to note that economic inputs are not the sole shaping factors
of capabilities. This approach is inherently multidimensional and accounts for various
elements determining the vector of capabilities. These elements may include the social
context in the broad sense, but also the institutional and cultural environment. As such,
the ‘other inputs’ may influence both positively or negatively an individual’s set of capabilities. One can, for example, imagine that a favorable institutional context, in the form
of democracy, the liberty of expression an individual has is much greater than that of an
individual living under an authoritarian regime.
The capability approach does not only focus on what people are able to ‘do’, but
also what people are able to ‘be’. The set of capabilities also entails freedoms like ‘being
happy’. This approach is therefore particularly adapted for the identification of states of
well-being as this thesis proposes in its last part.
Focusing specifically on the capability approach and putting aside Gasper’s well-being
problematique, figure 6 is one of the earlier schematic representations of the capability
approach by Ingrid Robeyns. This representation is broader and does not come from
an economic standpoint. Despite the presence of economical inputs (here, the ‘means to
achieve’, also labeled ‘commodities’ by Amartya Sen) compose only one of the multiple
inputs to the capability set, and in fine the functionings.
One specificity of the capability approach that is added by this representation is the
individual conversion factors. These factors are heavily conditioned by the previously
mentioned social context. They represent the ability of a person to convert their initial
inputs into actual capabilities. One can, for example, imagine that an individual who
possesses the resources to drive a car – i.e. the money, or even the car itself – may not

and personal context (Robeyns 2005, p. 98).

have the freedom to actually drive the same car. Such a situation may occur when this
individual is a woman and lives in a society where women do not have the right to drive a
car, for example. Such a consideration would be entirely ignored by previously discussed,
more traditional approaches.
Another important and well-depicted aspect of this representation is the element of
choice. This stage of the process intervenes between the capability set and the achieved
functionings. It allows highlighting the fact that all capabilities are not transformed into
achieved functionings per se. Such a conversion is dependent intrinsically bound to the
individual. This does not mean that the individual is the sole influencing element in
decision making. The two overhead boxes clearly show external social and environmental
factors.
Integrating both choice and the previously discussed conversion factors as processes
towards the achievement of functionings come with paramount theoretical considerations.
These two elements rely heavily on the considered individual. As such, it is important for
the capability approach to have a consistent outline of such an individual. The difficulties
this encompasses are vast and have cost the capability approach severe criticism. Relying
so heavily on the notion of individuals has resulted in the capability approach being treated
as methodological individualism. Such a critique can easily be deflected after the analysis
of figure 6, where the core of the analysis remains the individual, without denying her or his
environment and social context. Scholars have also proposed that ethical individualism is
a more adequate term to describe the capability approach (Robeyns 2005, Ballet, Dubois,
and Mahieu 2007).
64



5.1. CORE OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH

5.1.2

Capabilities and Functionings

In a later article, Ingrid Robeyns attempts to provide a core rationale for the capability approach, and more generally, she attempts to identify the characteristics all capability
theories should have (Robeyns 2016). To do so, she proposes the ‘cartwheel view’ in which
the core elements are common to all theories (at the center of the cartwheel) and where
other characteristics are considered modules (the wedges). She finds that the center of
the cartwheel contains a minima 12 characteristics, of which I will discuss capabilities
and functionings here, as Robeyns considers them to be “the distinctive feature of all
capabilitarian theories” (Robeyns 2016, p. 405).
It is important to note that the capability approach offers a conceptual leap from the
utilitarian and resource-based analyses that I have previously discussed from the standpoint of economists. A major distinction that is to be made to shift from an economical
to a capabilitarian view is to apprehend the inputs of both approaches, in a similar fashion as Des Gasper does when discussing the well-being problematique. In utilitarian and
resource-based schools of thought, the means and the ends may be confused into one single
element, namely income. As discussed previously, in these analyses, in order to increase
well-being one has to increase income and/or (overall) wealth. The capability approach
considers wealth as a valid input, but it does not constitute the sole variable. This is justified from a capabilitarian point of view, since it does not attempt to measure well-being
directly, but focuses rather on the identification and the eventually the quantification of
capabilities. As I have foreshadowed previously, these capabilities are to be understood
as positive freedoms, in other words, things that people could do.
In order to situate correctly both the distinction and the complementary of capabilities and functionings, Amartya Sen declares that “a functioning is an achievement,
whereas a capability is the ability to achieve. Functionings are, in a sense, more directly
related to living conditions, since they are different aspects of living conditions. Capabilities, in contrast, are notions of freedom, in the positive sense: what real opportunities
you have regarding the life you may lead” (Sen 1987b, p. 36). The choice of words has
induced misunderstanding and confusion, to the point that he finds that “capability is
not an awfully attractive word. It has a technocratic sound (. . . )”, whilst reasserting that
“the expression was picked to represent the alternative combinations of things a person
is able to do or be – the various ‘functionings’ he or she can achieve.” (Sen 1993, p. 30).
One illustration of this distinction between commodities and achieved functionings is
the distinction between ‘possessing a bike’ and ‘bicycling’. This example is found throughout the capabilities literature and clearly depicts the different paths of understanding that
65



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
the capability approach provides. It also allows the introduction of capabilities as an intermediary step, enriching considerably the understanding. If the objective of public policy
were to encourage the usage of bikes through a resourcist analysis, the focus would be the
providing of bikes or equivalent monetary resources. By omitting the notion of capabilities and linking commodities directly to achieved functionings, such an approach does not
account for other factors hindering the usage of bikes. These factors could nevertheless
be prohibitory for the functioning of bicycling and may include the infrastructure but
also cultural barriers. One can imagine for example a cultural barrier that forbids the
usage of bikes by women. Despite women having the monetary resources or even the bike
itself, they will not have the capability of riding the bike. This supplementary phase in
the understanding of the occurrence of achieved functionings considerably increases the
richness of the analysis.
Moreover, the study of functionings as outcomes of capabilities allows for a better
understanding of well-being. As Robeyns puts it, “functionings are constitutive elements
of well-being but also of ill-being” (Robeyns 2016, p. 406).
It is important to note that Sen considers the primary goal of capability driven policies
should be the enhancement of these capabilities. This is reflected in the title one of his
major books “Development as Freedom” (Sen 1999). Nevertheless, when considering the
range of capabilities closely, one may perceive the existence of ‘less and non-desirable’
capabilities. Indeed, Sen has never excluded from the vector of capabilities those which
may be harmful to others, for example. Taking this reasoning to an extreme one can easily
imagine the capability to commit murder. As such, capabilities are not value-laden and
may include every single freedom that an agent possesses. This is where the importance
of the individual, who possesses the said vector of capabilities, as well as her choices are
highlighted, which I will further develop in subsection 5.1.3. Moreover, such a capability
is constrained by the institutional context – such as laws – and the cultural environment.

5.1.3

Agency

This subsection aims to clarify the position of the agent within the capability approach. As foreshadowed in the previous subsection, providing a definition for the individual, i.e. an agent, comes accompanied by major ethical considerations. The positioning
and definition of the agent appear to be a major concern when applying the capability
approach to children. Specifics of children as agents are further developed in section 6.1.2.
Amartya Sen defines an agent as “someone who acts and brings about change, and
whose achievements can be judged in terms of her own values and objectives” (Sen 1999,
66



5.1. CORE OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
p. 12). Sen introduces values as being inherent to the agent and thus responds to the
issue previously raised regarding the fact that capabilities are initially non-value-laden.
All capabilities are therefore not transformed into achieved functionings. They must first
pass the filter of individual choice, the choice operated by the considered agent. As seen
in figure 6, the formation of choice is conditioned not only by the individual’s personal
characteristics such as psychology and individual experiences. It is also shaped by social
influences, which include social norms and institutions. As such, the social context of the
agent heavily conditions her choice-making process. The importance of the deep anchoring
of individuals in their social context has been highlighted notably by anthropologists, such
as Arjun Appadurai, who states that “there is no self outside a social frame, setting and
mirror” (Appadurai 2004, p. 67). Similarly, the concept of the aspirations window, as
coined by Debraj Ray also seems to be deeply rooted in the social context. He affirms
that “the window is formed from an individual’s cognitive world, her zone of “similar”,
“attainable” individuals. Our individual draws (...) from the lives, achievements, or ideals
of those who exist in her aspirations window.” (Ray 2006, p. 410)
This very close attention paid to the individual has earned the capability approach
heavy criticism. Specifically, the fact that the starting point of any capabilitarian approach is always the individual has resulted in this conceptual corpus to be depicted as
methodological individualism. This form of individualism considers that individuals preexist the society they live and evolve in. In other words, the societal phenomena can be
explained solely by the actions of the individuals that compose it. Such criticism seems
at least partially unfounded and may be addressed with reference to agency. As mentioned in subsection 5.1.2, agency comes with moral duty. I discussed this in the light of
“less desirable” capabilities. The moral compass which orientates the individual choices
converting capabilities into achieved functionings is subject to external, and more specifically societal, influences. In this manner, criticisms depicting the capability approach as
methodological individualism are rapidly emptied of their substance. Nevertheless, the
moral issue of the “less desirable” capabilities remains unaddressed.
This thesis often refers to Immanuel Kant, mainly in its epigraphs, notably when he
affirms that one should “act [so] as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or
in that of any other, in every case as an end withal, never as means only.” (Kant 1994,
p. xix). This ethical position allows to reflect on the capabilities which may pose issues
when transformed into achieved functionings. Onora O’Neill considers that:

“The requirement not to use others as mere means underlies ‘perfect’ duties,
which require rational natures not use one another (or themselves) as mere
dispensable and disposable means that can be destroyed or damaged or de67



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
ceived for arbitrary ends, so eliminating, eroding or by-passing agency. The
requirement to treat others as ends in themselves underlies ‘imperfect’ duties:
because human agents have fragile and undeveloped abilities and are always,
and often intensely, physically and mentally vulnerable to one another, they
must, if they are to ensure that moral action has a reliable place in their world,
sustain human abilities by developing their own capacities for action (talents)
and supporting one another’s pursuit of (permissible) ends.” (O’Neill 1998,
p. 219).

This interpretation of Kant allows a two-fold resolution of the issue that is raised
by the non-value laden nature of capabilities. On the one hand, and with regards to the
perfect duties, the preservation of an individual’s agency is fundamental. Both Kant and
O’Neill highlight that one’s agency must in no way or form deprive another individual
of her agency. This poses a first moral compass to the transformation of capabilities in
achieved functionings. For example, and in phase with Sen’s definition of agency, one may
not obstruct another to bring about change. On the other hand, the existence of imperfect
duties underlines the inherent interdependence of all agent’s responsibilities and freedoms.
In this line of thought, Martha Nussbaum writes that “The good of others is not just a
constraint on this person’s pursuit of her own good; it is a part of her good” (Nussbaum
2006, p. 158). As such, qualifying the capability approach as a purely individualistic
approach, seems to be a wrong interpretation. This does not mean that the initial and
main focus is not on individuals, but rather that the individual is deeply anchored in
her social, political and institutional environment. From this line of thought is derived
the idea that the capability approach is ethical individualism, rather than methodological
individualism (Ballet, Dubois, and Mahieu 2007, Robeyns 2005).
Finally, agency allows tying the capability approach even further with the concepts
of both well-being and aspirations. Several capability scholars have discussed and distinguished the notions of ‘agency goals’ and ‘well-being’. Well-being is defined by Sen as
the “‘well-ness’ of the person’s state of being” (Nussbaum and Sen 1993, p. 36), making
it a static and self-regarding concern. This may involve states of being such as being
well-nourished and sheltered. On the other hand, agency goals can be defined as “a person’s ‘agency freedom’ refers to what the person is free to do and achieve in pursuit of
whatever goals or values he or she regards as important” (Sen 1985c, p. 203) or more
plainly put, “the objectives the person sets himself or herself” (Burchardt 2009, p. 6). In
this sense, agency freedom refers to a dynamic, future-orientated process, in which the
agent attempts to attain her aspirations.
The distinction between agency goals and well-being allows accounting for the in68



5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
herent multi-dimensional nature of both the well-being outcomes and the process that
an agent undertakes to achieve them. This can be illustrated by Albert, who aspires to
become a well-learned and prominent astrophysicist. Once he reaches the state of being
this scientist, he will draw great amounts of ‘well-ness’ from it. This does not necessarily
mean that the process to attain that specific state of being is free of obstacles. One may
imagine that it includes countless hours of learning, researching and probably painful
exams. This distinction, therefore, has important implications for the role of education
within the capability approach. I will further discuss the role of education in the capability
approach in subsection 6.2.2.

5.2
5.2.1

Measuring Capabilities
Operationalization of the Capability Approach

I have touched upon several issues of operationalization of well being previously.
These methods all had in common that they attempted to empirically evaluate, be it
cardinally or ordinally well being, and were from the standpoint of economic science.
Within the capability approach, two major approaches to the operationalization may be
identified. This first is the one that relates to the selection of relevant capabilities, or
achieved functionings; in this line of thought, Robeyns argues that “not all applications
of the capability approach require empirical research techniques” (Robeyns 2006, p. 358).
The second encompasses the empirical applications to a variety of data sets, and which
attempt to numerically evaluate or rank capabilities and/or achieved functionings. In
this manner, Sen declares that “the capability approach is concerned primarily with the
identification of value-objects” and that it as such proceeds to “the identification of the
objects” and finally to evaluate “their relative values” (Sen 1992, p. 43). In the last part
of this thesis, I will apply a sequential use of both of these two approaches by initially
selecting relevant dimensions for the pupils and then letting them value them.
Before discussing these two strands of operationalization, it is to be noted that the
capability approach has benefited from a high degree of formalization in its early days.
Following his founding Tanner Lectures (Sen 1980), Sen proposes the following formalization of his textual outline of the capability approach (Sen 1985a, as summarized in
Brandolini and D’Alessio 1998):
Let xi be a vector of commodities possessed by person i and fi (xi ) a function converting the commodity vector into a vector of functionings bi , so that bi = fi (xi ). The
69



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
function fi (·) (...) is a member of Fi which contains all different ways open to the person to
transform the given commodities. Defining the valuation function by gei (·), where e refers
to the “evaluator” and i to the person whose well-being is under examination (where it
may be e = i), it is:

For a given commodity vector xi , the set of feasible functionings Ai is determined by the
set of converting functions Fi :

Ai = {bi |bi = fi (xi ), f or any fi (·) ∈ Fi }

The set Bi reflects the capabilities of the i th person.
The last equation (5.3) was later refined by Wiebke Kuklys, by integrating new
advancements in the specification of the capability approach (Kuklys 2005, p. 11):

Qi (Xi ) = {bi |bi = fi (c(xi )|zi , ze , zs ) ∀ fi ∈ Fi and ∀ xi ∈ Xi }

where
x ∈ X is a vector of commodities and X is the set of all possible commodity vectors
c=c(x) is a vector of characteristics of commodities, where
c is a function that maps commodities into the characteristics space
b=f(c(x|zi , ze , zs )) is a vector of activities and states of being (functionings), where
f ∈ F is a conversion function that maps characteristics of commodities into the space of
all possible conversion functions and
zi , ze , zs are conversion factors at the individual (i), social (s) and environmental (e) level,
which determine the rate of conversion from characteristics to functionings.
70



5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
Q is the capability set comprising all potential functionings an individual can achieve.
The attempt to represent the capability approach under the form of a set of equations
may be considered to shape the initial operationalization of the approach. They bring
clarity to the interconnections of complex dimensions that Sen initially pointed out in
his Tanner Lectures and which were then picked up and further developed by scholars
from a variety of academical backgrounds. Having this mathematical rigor may, therefore,
bring structure into the multitude of described dimensions, relations, and transformations.
Doing so comes with a cost nevertheless, as this formalization is not very appealing to
scholars from all fields. Moreover, the question as to whether they reflect the entire scope
of the capability approach remains open. As such, it may be discussed whether Sen’s
final equation (5.3) is a more general case of (5.4) proposed by Kuklys, or if it fails to
account for the specifically added conversion vectors (zi , ze , zs ) by the latter. Furthermore,
Kuklys adds the function c, as a function that determines further the “characteristics”
of the commodities, which is not explicitly present in Sen’s equations. Once again, his
way of formalizing his own approach does nevertheless not exclude such considerations de
facto.
Such considerations make the specification of the approach of primordial importance.
It is required to further operationalize the approach and such equations do not suffice by
themselves. As I will further discuss in sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 these equations can not be
used as provided here. One point that is worth noting here is that Sen opens the strand
of subjective evaluation in the most formal manner. He considers that it may be that e
= i, thus allowing well-being to be evaluated by the person who is being examined. I will
retain this point in my empirical application of the approach, by allowing the “evaluated”
the be the “evaluators” simultaneously.

5.2.2

Selecting relevant capabilities

When Sen asks his famous question “Equality of what?” (Sen 1980), his aim is
to shift the focus from resource-based and utilitarian approaches to his capability-based
alternative. This question may nevertheless also entail the still topical subject of “which
capabilities?”. There appears to be no consensus in the literature about this question,
especially since this seems like one of the major points of divergence between Amartya
Sen and Martha Nussbaum. This theoretical discord polarizes the literature where one
part applies the capability approach as defended by Sen and the other puts forward
the approach “à la Nussbaum”. As such, Nussbaum declares that Sen’s conception of
capabilities only gives “a general sense of what societies ought to be striving to achieve,
71



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
but because of Sen’s reluctance to make commitments about substance (which capabilities
a society ought most centrally to pursue), even that guidance remains but an outline.”
(Nussbaum 2003, p. 35). She finds that where Sen argues in favor of a deliberative process,
specific to the community to which the capability approach is applied, she defends the
necessity to draw up a list of “Central Human Capabilities” (Nussbaum 2003, p. 41).
Such a list is, by nature, universally applicable in the sense that it may be applied to
any human being, indifferently of gender, ethnicity, or nationality. She finds that her list
defines “general goals” which can then be “further specified by the society in question”
(Nussbaum 2003, p. 40). Following this initial specification, she defines her list as follows:
“1. Life. Being able to live to the end of a human life of normal length; not dying
prematurely, or before one’s life is so reduced as to be not worth living.
2. Bodily Health. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health; to be
adequately nourished; to have adequate shelter.
3. Bodily Integrity. Being able to move freely from place to place; to be secure against
violent assault, including sexual assault and domestic violence; having opportunities for
sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction.
4. Senses, Imagination, and Thought. Being able to use the senses, to imagine, think, and
reason – and to do these things in a “truly human” way, a way informed and cultivated by
an adequate education, including, but by no means limited to, literacy and basic mathematical and scientific training. Being able to use imagination and thought in connection
with experiencing and producing works and events of one’s own choice, religious, literary,
musical, and so forth. Being able to use one’s mind in ways protected by guarantees of
freedom of expression with respect to both political and artistic speech, and freedom of
religious exercise. Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid nonbeneficial
pain.
5. Emotions. Being able to have attachments to things and people outside ourselves; to
love those who love and care for us, to grieve at their absence; in general, to love, to
grieve, to experience longing, gratitude, and justified anger. Not having one’s emotional
development blighted by fear and anxiety. (Supporting this capability means supporting
forms of human association that can be shown to be crucial in their development.)
6. Practical Reason. Being able to form a conception of the good and to engage in
critical reflection about the planning of one’s life. (This entails protection for the liberty
of conscience and religious observance.)
7. Affiliation.
72



5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
A. Being able to live with and toward others, to recognize and show concern for other
human beings, to engage in various forms of social interaction; to be able to imagine the
situation of another. (Protecting this capability means protecting institutions that constitute and nourish such forms of affiliation, and also protecting the freedom of assembly
and political speech.)
B. Having the social bases of self-respect and nonhumiliation; being able to be treated
as a dignified being whose worth is equal to that of others. This entails provisions of
nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, caste, religion,
national origin.
8. Other Species. Being able to live with concern for and in relation to animals, plants,
and the world of nature.
9. Play. Being able to laugh, to play, to enjoy recreational activities.
10. Control Over One’s Environment.
A. Political. Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one’s life;
having the right of political participation, protections of free speech and association.
B. Material. Being able to hold property (both land and movable goods), and having
property rights on an equal basis with others; having the right to seek employment on
an equal basis with others; having the freedom from unwarranted search and seizure. In
work, being able to work as a human being, exercising practical reason, and entering into
meaningful relationships of mutual recognition with other workers.” (Nussbaum 2003,
pp. 41–42)
Despite Nussbaum allowing for this list to be “open-ended and subject to ongoing
revision and thinking” (Nussbaum 2003, p. 42) this list has undergone a large number
of criticisms, notably by Amartya Sen himself. He finds that “even with given social
conditions, public discussion and reasoning can lead to a better understanding of the role,
reach, and the significance of particular capabilities” (Sen 2004a, p. 80). He concludes
that he has “nothing against the listing of capabilities but must stand up against a grand
mausoleum to one fixed and final list of capabilities” (Sen 2004a, p. 80).
Further reluctance to the adoption of such a list entail both criticisms on a fundamental level and on a practical level. On the one hand, the fundamental criticisms reject
the very idea of such a list, mainly because of its direct and radical opposition with Sen’s
idea of debate and deliberation, such as voiced by Sabina Alkire who finds Nussbaum’s
initiative “a list of normative things-to-do” (Alkire 2002, p. 54). On the other hand, the

73



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
practical criticism addressed to the list of Central Human Capabilities are resumed by
Ingrid Robeyns as follows:
“Suppose that a social scientist applies the capability approach to gender
inequality assessment, or a village council uses the capability approach to
decide on priorities for the allocation of its funds, and they end up using
Nussbaum’s list of capabilities. In terms of the comprehensive outcome, it
would still be important that the social scientist or the village council go
through a democratic process for drawing up a list of priorities. This will give
a legitimacy to the outcome that simply copying Nussbaum’s list will lack.”
(Robeyns 2003, p. 68)
The strength of Robeyns’s critical regard on a predefined list lies in the fact that
Nussbaum’s list is not to be rejected per se. She acknowledges the fact that its composing
elements may be found perfectly applicable to practical situations and responding to the
specifics of the individual or the community which deliberate about which capabilities
appear central to them. Furthermore, and following Sen, the strength of the established
list does not lie in the elements of the list itself, but in the legitimacy it acquires through
public debate and deliberation. This thesis will find that the argument made by Robeyns
holds in the sense that deliberation and debate may indeed, at least partially, lead to the
Central Capabilities proposed by Nussbaum. It allows for the individuals to identify with
the measurement that is proposed based upon the deliberation. Furthermore, one may
imagine that if policies are implemented based upon such a list, the individuals who are
directly or indirectly affected by them, may be able to better relate to them. Since they
have actively participated in the elaboration of the list, they may find the policies to have
greater legitimacy solely because they were involved in the process of creation. This is
also one of the advantages I found in preceding a questionnaire with focus groups, which
I will further develop in Part III.
Sen, in direct opposition with Nussbaum, argues for a deliberative democracy rather
than the establishment of a list, open-ended and subject to change or not. The importance of deliberation may be viewed as Sen’s “Theory of Everything”. He goes as far
as questioning the foundations of Human Rights if they are not rooted in a deliberative
process and based upon sound theoretical founding. This does of course not mean that
he refutes Human Rights entirely, recognizing the “great urgency to respond to terrible
deprivations around the world” he finds that Human Rights in their current form have
allowed to “confront intense oppression or great misery, without having to wait for the
theoretical air to clear” (Sen 2004b, p. 317). Following Robeyns’s previously discussed
argument, a list of fundamental or constitutional rights might emerge, but can only find
74



5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
its legitimacy when it comes from public debate and reasoning. Sen pursues his exploration of human rights and their validity by drawing on Jeremy Bentham, who declared,
regarding the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens: “natural rights
is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights (an American phrase), rhetorical
nonsense, nonsense upon stilts” (Bentham 1843, p. 501). Once again, such a statement
does not imply that the author refutes the list of Human Rights that this French Declaration draws up as such. Extracted from the same Anarchical Fallacies, Jeremy Bentham
declares that:

“Right, the substantive right, is the child of law; from real laws come real rights;
but from imaginary laws, from “law of nature” [can come only] “imaginary
rights”.” (Bentham 1843, p. 523)

Bentham thus finds that rights ought to be identified, but that such rights can only
come from “real” laws. When reflecting specifically on Bentham’s example, the French
Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens from 1789, his argument appears to
be powerful. Despite this Declaration being considered as a considerable leap forward
in legal terms it is not to be omitted that they were proposed and ratified by the elites
of the society at the time. More specifically, the Constitutive Assembly that wrote this
Declaration was a selection of individuals convoked by the French King Louis XVI. This
Assembly might have been an attempt to represent the three estates, but was evidently
more advantageously organized for the clergy and the nobility. Despite the commoners
having more representatives, votes were counted per estate which resulted historically in 2
votes against 1; the clergy and the nobility protecting their privileges against the demands
of the commoners. Considering this process of decision, it is to be noted that it does not
result from public debate or deliberation. As such, Sen finds that a sound theoretical
foundation is to be found to ensure individual freedoms. As discussed in section 5.1.3
such a foundation may be found in Immanuel Kant’s writings. Sen thus argues that:

“A pronouncement of human rights includes an assertion of the importance of
the corresponding freedoms – the freedoms that are identified and privileged
in the formulation of the rights in question – and is indeed motivated by that
importance. For example, the human right of not being tortured springs from
the importance of freedom from torture for all. But it includes, furthermore,
an affirmation of the need for others to consider what they can reasonably do
to secure the freedom from torture for any person. For a would-be torturer, the
demand is obviously quite straightforward, to wit, to refrain and desist. The
75



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
demand takes the clear form of what Immanuel Kant called a perfect obligation. However, for others too (that is, those other than the would-be torturers)
there are responsibilities, even though they are less specific and come in the
general form of “imperfect obligations” (to invoke another Kantian concept).
The perfectly specified demand not to torture anyone is supplemented by the
more general, and less exactly specified, requirement to consider the ways and
means through which torture can be prevented and then to decide what one
should, thus, reasonably do.” (Sen 2004b, pp. 321–322)

Here, Sen touches upon the same perfect and imperfect obligations discussed in section 5.1.3. Following what he considers to be a more robust foundation of human freedom
than the mere declaration of “natural” rights, one may perceive the importance of the
selection of these very freedoms within each individual. In other words, without touching
upon the identification of freedoms based on public debate and deliberation, Sen finds that
individual obligations towards others are in fact, co-determined by others. Sen considers
that individuals should select the freedoms they have – or take – based upon what they
“should (...) reasonably do”. This requires the active process of thought and decision
of the considered individual in acknowledging and pondering their own freedoms before
taking them.
This active process has led to a strand of criticism addressed to Sen’s vision of
freedoms and the way in which they may be expressed. With reference to the democratic
process as defended by Sen, Jean-Michel Bonvin finds that “Sen’s entire approach leads to
a very demanding conception of democracy, in which the capability of deliberation of each
individual is actively solicited” (Bonvin 2005, p. 30, own translation). Drawing on Gerald
Cohen’s writings (Cohen 1990), Jean-Michel Bonvin pursues his criticism by pointing out
that “the capability approach by Sen adheres to a hyperactive ideal of human life, which
relegates to the second rank those who wish to aim for passive enjoyment of material
well-being” (Bonvin 2005, p. 30, referring to Cohen 1990, own translation). In the light
of this criticism, Bonvin finds that in this case, those who do not wish or do not have the
ability to deliberate would be in a disadvantaged position compared to those who actively
engage in deliberation. In his words, these individuals would benefit of “inferior status”
(Bonvin 2005, p. 30, referring to Cohen 1990, own translation).
These criticisms do appear to have two fundamental flaws. First of all, putting in
the same group those who do not have the ability and those who do not have the will to
participate seems to be a mistake. Sen’s consideration of participation in the selection
of freedoms does not exclude those who do not have the ability to do so. Indeed, based
upon Kant’s definition of obligations, others are de facto taken into consideration. This
76



5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
appeals to those who do have the ability to undeniably take into account those who don’t
or do to a lesser extent. The 2015 French law obliging all public buildings to be accessible
by everyone, specifically those who did not initially have this ability can be cited as an
example here. These buildings are generally where elections and public debates are held
(in town halls, for example), and people in wheelchairs might not have been able to
access these buildings, excluding them from the public debate, deliberation and choicemaking process. This example shows that Sen’s account of freedoms does allow people
who might not have been initially enabled to participate in the public sphere, may be
included through deliberate, specific and oriented actions. Cohen’s second argument,
regarding those who do not have the will to participate appears to be a merely rhetorical
one. Indeed, not participating in the public does not exclude them from benefiting from
its outcomes. An example that appears pertinent here is that of social benefits; those
who did not participate in the debate which introduces the benefits are not excluded from
these same benefits. Moreover, having the capability to participate in public debate and
decisions do not make this participation an obligation. Enjoying the results of this public
debate does nevertheless create new capabilities for everyone, without excluding those
who did not participate.

5.2.3

Empirical measurements of capabilities

Despite the previous discussion of selecting relevant capabilities, which appears to be
a requirement before being able to actually measure them, a vast portion of the existing
literature does not proceed to do so. Robeyns finds that “virtually all the quantitative
applications are using existing datasets (...) these data are not collected with the aim
of capturing people’s functionings well-being, let alone their capabilities” (Robeyns 2006,
p. 359). This is nevertheless not systematically the case and has largely evolved Robeyns’s
statement, and some counter-examples may be found with specific reference to education
and children, see for example Biggeri et al. 2006 and Hart 2012. I will, therefore, draw
largely on these existing methodologies in Part III, to both identify and measure pertinent
capabilities.
To better approach the classification of methodological techniques, Andrea Brandolini
and Giovanni D’Alessio propose a schematic representation, presented in figure 7. The
first element of “item-by-item analysis” presents its major advantages in the fact that
is does not reduce any complexity of the observed data2 . This technique looks at all
2
See for example Phipps 2002, who applies a comparative analysis of descriptive statistics, mainly
through response frequencies to the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (Canada), The
Statistics Norway Health Survey (Norway) and the National Survey of Children (United States).

5.2. MEASURING CAPABILITIES
the observed dimensions individually, and may also cross them among each other. On
the other hand, several weaknesses may also be identified. Such an approach, despite its
quantitative nature, may be subject to the subjectivity of the researcher. The selection of
the retained variables, their interpretation or cross-analysis only depends on the research
who may, even unwillingly, introduce his subjective interpretation of the data or observed
situations in the field into the analysis. Moreover, the analysis may lack completeness
such as missing links between the variables. Especially in large databases, such a process
may prove interminably long and rapidly grows in complexity, which makes it harder to
apprehend for the researcher applying such a technique.
The second group comprises all the “comprehensive analyses”, which in turn, regroup
the “non-aggregative strategies” and the “aggregative strategies”. Vector analysis focuses
on the ordering of ensembles of capabilities, regrouped in vectors. On the other hand,
sequential dominance is defined as the comparisons between different situations. These
situations may include analysis between different groups or between different epochs. The
multivariate techniques regroup a large body of techniques such as fuzzy set theory or
structural equation modeling3 . I will further develop an original non-aggregative strategy,
specifically a multivariate technique, in section 8.2.1.
The aggregative strategies are the most widely used in communication for the general
public. This may be attributed to their “communicational advantage” (Brandolini and
D’Alessio 1998, p. 19) since they reduce all the information in an index. These strategies
are championed by the Human Development Index, which is widely used and well-known.
The strength of such indicators is also their major flaw, as Sen indicates: “the passion for
aggregation makes good sense in many contexts, but it can be futile or pointless in others.
(...) When we hear of variety, we need not invariably reach for our aggregator” (Sen 1987b,
p. 33). The reduction in information operated by aggregation tends to simplify, reduce
if not entirely erase pertinent dimensions. Such measures also make the line between
the level of analysis fuzzy. Especially from an economist’s standpoint, this distinction is
non-negligible, as Flavio Comim puts it:

“At a macro level, not many differences are possible, since, for instance, aggregates on mortality levels of female illiteracy will provide the same information
either from a capability or from a ‘utilitarian’ perspective. The significant difference lies in micro-economic studies where the valuational foundation of the
Capability Approach allows people to express their ‘powers of discrimination’
with regard to the good life.” (Comim 2001, p. 10).
3
See for example Di Tommaso 2006 and Addabbo and Di Tommaso 2011, who present examples of
Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) approaches, specifically applied to children.

79



CHAPTER 5. THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
The issue underlined by Comim and the previous discussion on the selection of capabilities leads me to adopt a micro-oriented selection of relevant capabilities for the
observed group of individuals, i.e. schooled children. I will then use a non-aggregative
strategy to attempt to preserve as much of the information as possible contained in the
original questionnaire. This approach will be further developed in section 8.2.1.

Children and the Capability Approach

onsidering children with regards to the Capability Approach poses several issues. As
explored previously, this theoretical approach requires the abilities of choice-making
and self-determination through agency. These requirements are not evident when considering children. When considering historically the position of children in a society, one
notes that they have not always benefited from the attention, nor the understanding they
have nowadays. This lack of recognition, which can be referred to as “theoretical orthodoxy” (Dahmen 2014, p. 153), has been questioned and revised since the 1990’s. This
theoretical issue has been noted and discussed previously by scholars from a capabilitarian
point of view, see for example Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim 2011.

C

This section will then propose to review this orthodoxy in the light of the new sociology of childhood in order to attempt to create a theoretical foundation for the application
of the capability approach to children.
“The tradition within both sociology, psychology and educational studies has been to
ignore or deny children any sort of status that would ground what children do in socially
meaningful terms. Children are thought of as adults-in-waiting; that is, children exist
81



CHAPTER 6. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH TO
CHILDREN
with reference to what they will become - competent, rational adults.” (Wyness 1999,
p. 354)
When researching self-determination with regard to children, be it from a conceptual
or from a policy-making perspective, one is inevitably confronted with the issue of children’s rights. A distinction is to be made between children’s rights in terms of nurture on
one hand and in self-determination on the other (Ruck, Abramovitch, and Keating 1998).

6.1.1

Children from a historical perspective

The debate around children, their rights, their abilities, and their well-being does not
seem to have reached a consensus. Where some find matter to protect either children’s
welfare or children’s rights (Baumrind 1978), others further distinguish the children’s
rights into nurturance rights on the one hand, and self-determination rights on the other
(Ruck, Abramovitch, and Keating 1998). These views are not necessarily found compatible with each other. For example, it can be argued that granting children greater
self-determination rights may conflict with children’s rights to be cared for and nurtured.
Allowing a child not to eat because he doesn’t want to is indeed contradictory with the
same child’s right to being properly fed.
Historically, the question of child rights was not a question as such, nor was their
ability to choose for themselves. Stuart Hart finds that “prior to the 16th century most
children beyond six years of age were considered to be small adults and were not separated
from adults as a class” (Hart 1991, p. 53). As such, no distinction was made between
what we consider nowadays as (very) young children. They were expected to perform work
according to their competencies and were treated accordingly. Children did not draw the
corresponding recognition from their work or status nevertheless, as they were “considered
to be chattel” (Hart 1991, p. 53). This also translated in the legal age of marriage to be 13
in the middle ages, and the heir to the throne of France could become King upon the same
age. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the status of children underwent some significant
changes, where they “were valued for contributing to family work and supporting parents
in their old age”. They were remained nevertheless “without individual identity to the
extent that they were considered replaceable and interchangeable.” (Hart 1991, p. 53).
When reflecting upon child labor specifically, up to the middle of the 19th century,
child labor was considered a banality. “Not only were children used in labor, the labor of
children was a social fact, not a social problem” (Bremner 1971, p. 103). The banality of
this social fact is conveyed and denounced by Victor Hugo in this “Contemplations” in
82



6.1. CHILDREN AND THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
18561 .
It is only at the beginning of the 20th century that children started to be considered as
“the essential human resources whose mature form would determine the future of society”
(Hart 1982, p. 4). This view nevertheless still considers children as deprived of any form of
agency, as they are mere adults-in-becoming, rather than individuals for themselves. This
leads authors to consider that children are “studied as passive beings structured by the
social context of the family or the school, now research should focus on children’s agency,
on the ways that children construct their own autonomous social worlds” (Freeman 1998,
p. 436).

6.1.2

Child Agency

The historical evolution of the place of children in society as well as “theoretical orthodoxy” (Dahmen 2014, p. 153) has led to what is now referred to as “institutionalized youth
land” also called “youth land”. (Reynaert and Roose 2014, p. 175). This compartmentalization between youth and adults has resulted in their exclusion from decision-making
and autonomy. This youth land may be defined as “preparatory arenas that implement
a principle of integration by means of separation.” (Honig 2008, p. 201). In this line of
thought, youth is seen as becoming rather than being; instead of considering the children
for what they are now, they are treated as what they will become. This deprives children
of crucial aspects of agency, as they are not given any possibility of choice, nor are their
current skills and competence acknowledged.
With regards to mainstream economic science, and specifically that of Human Capital, such positioning of children results in them being viewed as currently ‘valueless’, and
they ought to be educated in order to foster higher productivity and to prevent future unemployment. Such a viewed is heavily maintained in the french zeitgeist with the popular
expression “passe ton bac d’abord” (“graduate first”), which may have originated from
a film bearing the same title in 1978. This expression is typically employed by parents
towards children who express their wishes for the future, be it in terms of higher education
or a job. It allows parents (or teachers) to simply discard the ability of choice of their
children (or pupils) by conditioning their entire future on the successful obtainment of
their diploma.
Within human capital, no explicit reference to the importance of agency for children is
made. Nevertheless, it introduces a timid primary form of agency by empowering children

through education. This theoretical framework conveys the idea that school increases
productivity and therefore yields higher salaries. It also posits that the individual, here
the child in school, has the choice to educate herself. Nevertheless, and as discussed in
section 6.2.2, such a choice is heavily conditioned by the familial environment. This is
particularly true for countries where education is not universal and free. Human Capital
Theory does not address this issue and therefore only conveys an implicit and thin form
of future agency.
The new sociology of the childhood attempts to counterbalance this theoretical orthodoxy and the derived youth land. This framework considers that “the actions and
dispositions that constitute agency, including ‘choice’ and ‘competence,’ are not politically empty or neutral categories. Instead, the actions and dispositions of children become,
in this approach, mutable, contingent and meaningful: revealing both the role of individual agency in reproducing social norms and the potential for individual agency to disrupt
them” (Valentine 2011, p. 355). Following Kylie Valentine, this view of children introduces a major shift in comparison to both human capital theory and the sociological youth
land. It endorses the idea that children are indeed individuals with their own agency.
From a capabilitarian standpoint, Comim et al. 2011, Valentine’s view has been
attenuated by acknowledging that “children may need different resources and policies to
be able to enjoy the same basic capabilities and achieved functionings” (Comim et al. 2011,
p. 8). Furthermore, despite recognizing the autonomy and independence of children’s
agency, thus allowing it to leave the youth land, it may suffer some shortcomings. I have
discussed such a situation form a capabilitarian point of view in section 6.2.2. To remedy
this, Saito considers that “education makes a child autonomous in terms of creating a
new capability set for the child” (Saito 2003, p. 27). In turn, this empowerment in terms
of autonomy and capabilities (in the form of education) allows children to be individuals,
endowed with agency. As such, in light of the Capability Approach, all individuals are too
be considered with their specific traits, commodities, and socio-institutional environment.
The issue should not be trying to identify a group and it’s characteristics, but finding a
manner to reason about every specific individual.
In this line of thinking, Mortier 2002 claims that “we are all children”. This incites
us to think the capability approach specifically for every individual. Particularly for the
application of the approach, it allows focussing on the identification of the context in
which the individual’s agency is shaped, rather than identifying individuals for which we
assume a context ex ante. This is has been identified by Diana Baumrind, who finds
that “youths possess insights concerning family life, educational environments, and social
conditions which are unique to their developmental stage and to their special place within
the social context” (Baumrind 1978, p. 180). The statistical method that I will apply in
84

the last part of this thesis attempts to reflect this theoretical placement of children. It
does not determine a model beforehand and allows children to take possession of their
agency.

6.1.3

Evolving Capabilities

So far, and as represented mainly in figure 6, capabilities have been presented as a
static, unidirectional process. As I will further discuss in section 6.2.2 – when discussing
education and capabilities – capabilities are found to be far from a linear phenomenon.
Furthermore, when integrating aspirations – which are by nature future-oriented – in the
analytical framework of the capability approach, a dynamic vision ought to be developed.
As justly noted by Martha Nussbaum:
“it is a salient feature of human life (...) that it is lived only once, and in one
direction. So to imagine the recurrence of the very same circumstances and
persons is to imagine that life does not have the structure it actually has. And
this changes things.” (Nussbaum 1992, p. 39)
The notion of time has been discussed since the early stages within the capability
approach, ranging from attempts to introduce time with the framework (see for example
Comim 2003, Comim 2004, D’Agata 2007) to the identification of a “circularity problem”
(Binder and Coad 2011, p. 327). This circularity problem aims to point out the fact that
resources, or commodities, conversion factors and functionings may all be “endogenous
and interrelated”. With specific reference to education, Binder and Coad find that “an
individual’s education can be conjectured to be influenced by resources. But education
can also have an influence on resources (...). Moreover, the achievement in this dimension
might strongly influence functioning achievement in the health dimension” (Binder and
Coad 2011, p. 328). These authors follow – and refer to – human capital theory to
justify their statement. Indeed, with regards to for example Becker 1964, an individual’s
education increases her future income. On the other hand, financial resources that an
individual possesses may also heavily influence the education they are able to obtain,
especially in countries that have a highly developed private educational sector. A clear
entanglement may, therefore, be found between commodities, conversion factors, and
functionings.
To further this finding, and with specific attention to children, Madoka Saito finds
that education is inherently future-orientated. Its very interest lies in the future enhancement of the child’s freedoms. This corroborates the previously discussed standpoint from
85



CHAPTER 6. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH TO
CHILDREN
which current functionings, attained through education, feedback into future commodities. In this line of thought, Saito declares that “when dealing with children, it is the
freedom they will have in the future rather than the present that should be considered.
Therefore, as long as we consider a person’s capabilities in terms of their life-span, the CA
seems to be applicable to children” (Saito 2003, p. 26). It is following this idea of evolving and dynamically adapting capabilities that Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim propose the
dynamic illustration of the capability approach, specifically applied to children presented
in figure 8.
Drawing on Comim 2004, these authors find that evolving or dynamic capabilities
may be defined as “capabilities that change, that have a beginning, a flourishing and a
transformation into something else, qualitatively different” (Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim
2011, p. 34). This is true for adults, and even more so for children when considering the
fact that children undergo a “rapid cognitive development can be facilitated or reduced by
the presence or absence of instrumental capabilities such as being able to be adequately
educated” (Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim 2011, p. 31).
Figure 8 then presents an integrated model of dynamic capabilities with children lying
at its core. This representation is consistent with the rationale of the static representation
Robeyns provided in figure 6, while also accounting for the developments on aspiration
formation as developed by Hart (Hart 2012). These additions are mainly represented
in the core (circular) part of figure 8, focusing the attention specifically on the child.
It shows that the conversion factors of the commodities, including the crucial factor of
choice, are heavily conditioned by the family, community and the state. These instances
play a particular role to play in both the promotion and the limitation of the capabilities
of the child. An interesting discussion on this point
Finally, this figure adds a dynamic dimension to the capability approach, adding
loops that feed the vector of achieved functionings back into the conversion factors and
even directly point back at the child. When considering education as a dynamic process,
the functioning of ‘being educated’ may indeed directly impact the child on several levels.
The knowledge of the child may, for example, be increased by education and allow her
of him to make more informed choices in the future about converting one or another
capability into an achieved functioning. This idea is captured in the official readings of
the Human Development and Capability Association2 :
“At the heart of the notion of a capability is a conception that a person is
able to develop an understanding of valued beings and doings. This in itself
2
This Association was founded by Amartya Sen and aims to be “a global community of academics
and practitioners focused on people-centered development and the capability approach”

is a powerful argument for forms of education, through which an individual
can explore her own conception of what it is she has reason to value. If
an important normative aspiration is capability expansion, then developing
education is a part of expanding the capacity to make valued choices in other
spheres of life.” (Unterhalter, Vaughan, and Walker 2007, pp. 3–4)

6.2

The Role of Education within the Capability Approach

6.2.1

Broadening the Role of Education in comparison to Human Capital Theory

I have discussed in the first part of this thesis some of the fundamentals of human
capital theory, its anchorage in economic theory and explored some of its limitations. In
the words of Amartya Sen “after acknowledging its relevance and reach” it is important to
“go beyond the notion of human capital” (Sen 1997, p. 1960). In this subsection, I would
like to go beyond this theoretical corpus and compare and contrast it with the capability
approach. This seems pertinent since “both perspectives put humanity at the center of
attention” (Sen 1997, p. 1959). Nevertheless, as foreshadowed in the first part of this
thesis and as developed in the previous section, one cannot stop at the formalization of
human beings in the neoclassical framework of human capital. As Immanuel Kant, Onora
O’Neill, and others have expressed in various manners, “because human beings are not
merely means of production (even though they excel in that capacity), but also the end
of the exercise.” (Sen 1997, p. 1960).
When comparing the two approaches, and specifically with regards to education, it
is to be noted that they can be differentiated by looking at the considered outcomes.
On the one hand, the human capital approach focuses on economic growth, whereas the
capability approach gives importance to the quality of human life (Unterhalter 2009).
More specifically, Sen distinguishes between three different roles fulfilled by education,
which are – at least partially – ignored by the human capital approach (Sen 1992). He finds
that education plays an instrumental social role. As I will further discuss in subsection
6.2.2, school becomes a primary social group to which pupils belong and which shapes
the social actors they will become. As such, education enables the ability of youngsters,
and thus the future voters, to engage in public dialogue. Secondly, he considers the
instrumental process role which can be understood as the “capacity to participate in
88



6.2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
decision-making processes at the household, community or national level” (Unterhalter
2009, p. 214). Finally, Sen identifies an empowering and distributive role. The empowering
role of education has been received considerable attention in the literature over time and
plays a particular role in the empowerment of women, the disadvantaged, and otherwise
marginalized groups in society to gain understanding and access to the public debate and
decision-making process. This then enables the redistribution of resources, power, and
freedoms to these same, initially excluded groups.
The tables 1 and 2, adapted from Bussi 2014, pp. 7–8, allow an overview of various
elements that may distinguish human capital theory from the capability approach.
The rationales of both the human capital theory and the capability approach are discussed
respectively in sections 2.2 and 5.1.1. The conception of the welfare subject in these tables
is highly pertinent for the development of this thesis, as it attempts to identify the impact
of schools on child well-being. In this perspective, this table recapitulates the main
distinctions between the two approaches. Namely, the prospected well-being outcomes
are fundamentally different as human capital theory focuses on the neoclassical notion of
utility where the capability approach stresses the importance of agency. Moreover, the
value of education is set at a different level; where the capability approach advocates for
the intrinsic value of education, human capital theorists find only an instrumental role in
education, which is expected to increase utility through higher productivity and thus a
higher income. The intervention models proposed by the two approaches and according
to Bussi may be distinguished with regards to their points of focus. Indeed, where human
capital lays the focuses on the economic outcomes, the capability approach proposes a
holistic approach to the individual at work. This allows the capability approach to be
more inclusive, account for transitional periods and integrate individual aspirations.
As such, the capability approach allows for a wider and intrinsically multidimensional
conceptualization of the agent at work, where the human capital framework only presents
the economic outcomes of work. This allows the capability approach integrating notions
such as individual well-being and aspirations, where Becker’s conceptualization fails to do
so.

6.2.2

Education and Capabilities

One may argue that education is rather an inhibition to freedom than it actually
expands it. This seems to have a particular echo in countries, like France, where one has
the legal obligation to schooling until a certain age is reached. Such a statement is almost
unanimously accepted by the children whom I interviewed for this thesis. When they are
initially asked why they go to school, they have a very hard time finding its purpose. On
the other hand, when they are asked what they would do if school was non-compulsory,
they find a wide range of activities they would do, rather than going to school. Following
this, the pupils would say that school hinders their liberty to do what they actually wanted
to do. Despite this, when taking into account the time component of school, it has been
argued that compulsory schooling permits to “develop the judgement of the person to be
able to value in which way it is appropriate to use capabilities through education” (Saito
2003, p. 29). As such, school is inherently future-orientated. Important outcomes of
school lie predominantly in the future through the development of future capabilities. On
a psychological level, such a finding follows the ‘Marshmallow Experiment’ as described
by (Shoda, Mischel, and Peake 1990). This experiment aims to view cognitive and selfregulatory competencies of adolescents. It finds that those children who had a higher
resistance to their own will of instant gratification have better cognitive and self-regulatory
competencies than their peers. When relating this experiment to school and its futureorientated outcomes, those pupils who are willing to invest in school (thus renouncing to
current liberties) are expected to have higher returns to their initial investment. These
returns go far beyond the scope that is proposed by the economic analysis of education
as proposed by human capital theory, for example. When viewing education through
the lens of the capability approach, outcomes of education are manyfold. Some of these
outcomes are summarized in table 3.
By synthesizing educational outcomes from a capabilitarian perspective (table 3),
Rosie Vaughan shows how this approach not only encompasses human capital theory but
also how it largely extends it. This is represented by the shift of the considered outputs
of education. Focus is here put on well-being and agency, where it is solely concerned
with employment and income in the human capital approach. Moreover, employment is
still present in the synthesis proposed by Vaughan. This table presents employment as
a contributor to well-being while relegating it to the status of a means rather than the
end of the entire theoretical framework. In this sense, human capital may be viewed as a
theoretical subset of the capability approach.
Table 3 is also consistent with Saito’s findings of education being future-oriented.
In line with Saito’s findings and consistently with the evolving capabilities as presented

CHAPTER 6. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE CAPABILITY APPROACH TO
CHILDREN
by Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim 2011 in figure 8, Vaughan describes how education expands “options”, “choice”, and “preference formation”. As such, education appears as
a cornerstone of the capability approach. As discussed previously choice is fundamental
in the transformation of capabilities into actual functionings. The formation of tastes
and preferences is therefore crucial to each individual that is considered in the capability
approach. This also tightly relates to aspirations, as school allows for children to find out
about “which options are available”. School thus becomes a canal through which children
may enhance the vector of their capabilities by finding out about subjects they could or
would not have found out about by themselves.
To further represent the impact of education on a child from a capability perspective, Vaughan proposes figure 9, which is Robeyns’s stylized representation, which she
annotated to indicate where education intervenes. She then distinguishes between two
different roles “depending on which particular capability is being considered” with on the
one hand the case where functionings are considered (indicated with “A” in figure 9) and
on the other hand she considered the conversion factors impact (indicated with “B” in
figure 9).

This figure is an interesting visual representation of the spheres on which education
might impact an individual from with regards to the capability approach. It nevertheless
94



6.2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
appears to fall short of some of the dimensions education impacts. As table 3 indicates,
education can also have an influence on “preference formation” mechanisms as presented
in figure 9. Education has been found to contribute to the range of options a child possesses (by knowing and learning about them), and it therefore directly influence the ability
to shape a child’s preference. This might have deserved a fourth label (“C”) to be added
in this representation. In turn, the preference formation influences the element of choice
through which the child transforms capabilities into achieved functionings. Furthermore,
and with regards to the evolving and dynamic nature of capabilities (as for example presented in figure 8), the achieved functionings feedback not only into the various conversion
factors but also into the commodities (here the “means to achieve”) of the child.
Even though the goal of this representation is not to provide a dynamic representation
of capabilities, this raises specific questions with regards to children. Specifically, it may
be asked to which extent a child is in control of her or his commodities and then to
which degree the child is able to convert these commodities into actual capabilities. As
discussed for example by Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim 2011, the conversion (and possession)
of a child’s commodities are heavily dependent on the commodities detained by parents.
This then may allow to add a fifth label (“D”) to the “social context” in figure 9. The
end of this section will then discuss the ‘social’ influence on a child’s ability to convert
education into capabilities and/or achieved functionings.
In the French context, high schools have particularly dense presence times of its
pupils, even when compared to other European countries (Kamette 2011). Indeed, at the
time of this study, pupils can have classes from 8 o’clock in the morning to 6 o’clock in the
late afternoon, 5 days a week. Jérôme Ballet, Jean-Luc Dubois and François-Régis Mahieu
find that “belonging to a community and participating in its day-to-day life has an impact
on the level of well-being of the individuals” (Ballet, Dubois, and Mahieu 2007, p. 186).
School, therefore, becomes a primary community to which the pupils belong. This social
context will heavily condition the individual the pupil will become. With regard to the
profound social anchoring of agency in the social context, education plays a paramount
role in it’s shaping. Robeyns considers the capability approach to be highly prone to the
analysis of the impact of education and finds that it “looks at what education means for
a life that is composed of many different dimensions and sees education as a contribution
to the development of the kind of person one will become and the types of things one
will be able to do.” (Robeyns 2016, p. 399). As discussed previously, this correlates with
Saito’s interpretation of education as being future-orientated. Despite the evident fact
that education is restrictive now (it keeps youngsters from doing whatever they want to
do) it allows an increase in future freedoms. Let me consider the example of Albert again,
who is now an astrophysicist, and very happy to be so. Had he never been obligated to

study physics in high school (when he would have preferred to go to the cinema with his
friends at the time), he would never have been able to become the prominent physicist
he is now.
The idea of aspiring only to what one knows, or reproducing one’s social environment
has been largely studied, specifically applied to the French educational context. This is
notably the case for Pierre Bourdieu’s now seminal sociological observations (Bourdieu
2016, Bourdieu and Passeron 2016, Bourdieu and Passeron 2018). Caroline Hart finds that
Bourdieu’s observations can very well “complement Sen’s Capability Approach” (Hart
2012, p. 49). More specifically, Hart describes how the understanding of the Bourdieusian
conceptualization of capital can enrich the understanding of both commodities and their
related conversion factors within the capability approach.
Figure 10 can be viewed as an enhancement of the previously discussed figure by
Robeyns (figure 6). It specifically enhances the ‘means to achieve’ described by adding
supplementary stages before the occurrence of a capability. In the light of Bourdieu’s
writings, Hart finds that the commodities of children are to be considered with regard
to their family context. Coined as ‘family capital’, this commodity relies on elements
such as parent’s and sibling’s education, but also the presence of books in the family
house for example. It is important to note that when Hart refers to ‘family capital’, she
also includes “school/community capital” (Hart 2012, p. 54). Kevin Marjoribanks finds
that such a form of capital also comes from adult-child relationships (Marjoribanks 2002).
Regarding the second stage of commodity capital as developed in figure 10, namely the
‘individual capital’ it is important to note that a child with highly educated parents who
value the education of their child, may still not be able to achieve the higher individual
capabilities that are expected as an outcome. This is due to the conversion factors linking
family and individual capital. One may imagine a particular case of children with mental
disabilities or, more commonly, resistance of the child to the usage of family capital.
Let us go back to Albert, whose parents are both psychologists with a wide network in
academics. This could be considered as a strong family capital, which Albert can then
convert into his personal capital. His parents have vast amounts of documentation and
knowledge to share with Albert within their domain of expertise, as much as they could
96



6.2. THE ROLE OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
use their network to open doors to prestigious universities. Despite this, Albert does not
want to become a psychologist. He, therefore, does not fully convert the family capital –
which his parents might even be too forceful with – into his personal capital. Were his
parents the astrophysicists he wants to become, this conversion process would be more
evident. Remains nevertheless the last conversion factors, linking individual capital to
capability. Hart finds that “an individual may be well educated, rich and knowledgeable
of high culture but may not be able to achieve the valued functioning of being well-liked
because they lack the ability/knowledge of how to use their capital commodities effectively
to achieve this goal.” (Hart 2012, pp. 55–56).
In light of the discussions in this chapter, I argue that the capability approach allows
for a highly pertinent framework to evaluate educational outcomes. With specific regards
to aspirations and well-being, the capability approach allows evaluating education in a
new light, shedding off the linear relation of causality of education on productivity and
salary outcomes as prescribed by mainstream economics.

his section aims to present the French secondary schooling system globally, at the
time of my study in early 2017. At that point in time, there was no mention of
the French government of the intended reform that was introduced during 2018. This
reform particularly affects the lycée, from which the “traditional” 3 sections were entirely
removed, to be replaced with a higher degree of choice in terms of classes, and thus
exams. These sections were replaced with 6 common subjects for all pupils, completed
with 5 subjects of the pupil’s choice. It is to be noted that none of the interviewed pupils
were affected by this reform, as it was introduced progressively, only applying to those
who would newly enter lycée from 2018 onward.

French high school is divided into two different schools, starting with “collège”, starting at age 11 to 15. The second is “lycée”, where pupils enter after obtaining the “Diplôme
National du Brevet”, prepared in their collège. The lycée has pupils from ages 15 to 18
and is considered as the first time pupils start to make their decisions in terms of classes

7.1. GENERALITIES
I will focus here exclusively on classes ranging from the sixième to the Cycle terminal.
The collège corresponds to the second phase of Cycle III and the entirety of Cycle IV.
The lighter areas on the right of these cycles (ULIS1 , DIMA2 , UPE2A3 and SEGPA4 )
correspond to specific classes, integrated within traditional collèges or in different structures entirely, specifically for children with special educational needs. This ranges from
children with mental and/or physical disabilities (ULIS) to children who encounter other
challenges with the traditional system (SEGPA). I have not conducted any interviews in
any of these classes, and only one of the surveyed lycées had a ULIS class, representing
10 students out of more than 1000.
As this figure shows, the collège does not offer any form of diversity, and all students
follow roughly the same classes. With regards to the lycée, a larger panel of choice
is offered to its pupils. From right to left, the CAP5 and “Bac pro”6 are specifically
designed for the professionalization of its pupils. Along with French, mathematics, and
history, these pupils are trained for a specific trade. The BT (“Brevet Technicien”) is
similar to the CAP. Finally, the Bac Technologique lies in between the Bac Général and
the BT/CAP. It does not prepare for a specific trade, but rather into a sector. It provides
“general” classes in a higher proportion than the BT, Bac Pro, and the CAP, whilst also
offering deeper insight into sectors such as Healthcare, Laboratory Techniques, Agronomic
Sciences or Management, for example. It is to be noted that either of these baccalaureates
allows the student to apply for university, but rarely provide the fundamentals to succeed.
Students will generally follow intensive summer schools or an entire year of supplementary
formation before universities accept their applications.
This study was held solely with students following a Bac Général, ranging from the
Seconde Générale et technologique to the Terminale générale.
The particularity of dividing high school into two different schools in France is translated into their administrative organization. This organization is a mixture of highly
centralized within the state and can be very local at the same time, specifically for the
collèges. Table 4 shows to whom the different domains of the organization of these schools

do not permit them to be integrated into regular classes.
2
Dispositif d’Initiation aux Métiers en Alternance; for students from age 15 onward, who wish to be
trained for a specific trade. Being 15 years old in a collège generally indicates that the pupil has repeated
more than once.

sufficient level to follow regular classes.

are affected. As can be noted, the pedagogical aspect of these schools is all centralized by
the state. As such the programs and the teachers are all nationally selected and affected
to the schools throughout the country. Every high school student, therefore, undergoes
the same program which is taught by nationally trained teachers.
On the other hand, the material investments are made on a more local level. Since the
2015 reform of the regions, France went from 22 to 13 regions, which makes the regions
much less “local”. Nevertheless, the departments were unaffected by this reform, and
remain very representative of their local territory. As such, collèges are built and upheld
by these relatively local instances7 .
7

Primary schools are under the responsibility of communes. Since France counts almost 35 000 communes, some as small as several hundreds of inhabitants. This makes primary schools deeply anchored
in their local territory.

Figure 12 shows the division of pupils within the previously discussed forms of high
school. The “formations en collège” are non-divisible and incorporate all the different sections within collèges as discussed previously. The “formations générales et technologiques”
regroup both the Bac général and the Bac technologique. As mentioned previously, this
study focuses on students in collèges and those studying for their Bac général. Finally
the “formations professionelles” encompasses the BTs, Bacs pro, and CAPs.

7.1.2

Collèges

This school has 4 classes, starting with the “sixième” and ending with the “troisième”.
This first part of high school revolves around the idea of equality for all. There are very
few choices to make in terms of classes, with the exceptions of languages. A pupil may
decide to take Latin starting in “cinquième” or not, as well as choose between Spanish or
German starting in “quatrième”. It is to be noted that none of the collèges at which my
study was conducted offered the possibility of choosing German, and all students would
have to take Spanish by default. As such, collèges are highly uniformed schools were
pupils have the same subjects. The collège then prepares its students for the “Diplôme
National du Brevet”. This diploma is nevertheless not compulsory whatsoever to pursue
high school in a lycée. Despite this particularity of the diploma, the success rate of the
pupils in collège in constantly increasing as is shown in figure 13.

7.1.3

Lycées

Lycées generally host pupils from ages 15 to 18. As mentioned previously, this part
of high school is where diversity in choice is introduced, different “orientations” can be
chosen. Upon completing their collège, pupils first choose between either a “professional”,
a “technological” or a “general” orientation. This thesis focuses exclusively on the general path. During the period of the study, the general section was divided into three
sections, literary, socio-economical and scientific. The pupil chooses her/his orientation
after completing the seconde générale, which is common to all students.
As figure 14 shows, there is a clear predominance of the scientific section within
lycées. The fact that the socio-economic section progressively counted more pupils at the
cost of the literary section, may be explained by the social stigma that comes with the
latter section. The literary section has an increasingly negative reputation, specifically
due to the fact that it is believed to have a negative impact on higher education (i.e. that
universities do not, or less willingly, accept pupils coming from the literary section).
Moreover, the scientific section is viewed as that of excellence. It is not uncommon to
find pupils who want to study economics in university chose the scientific section rather
than the more intuitive socio-economic section for their aspirations.

The French Secondary Schooling System, Well-Being, Aspirations, and the Meritocratic Myth

Specific studies have been discussed relating to the capability approach, aspirations,
well-being and school, but none of these were applied to France. There are very few studies
that link the capability approach directly to the French secondary schooling system8 . The
vast majority of studies that are specific to the French schooling system apply a more
‘traditional’ socio-economical approach. Such approaches encompass on the one hand
those economic studies which heavily rely on human capital (as discussed extensively in
Part I) and on the other the sociological approach championed by Pierre Bourdieu (see
Bourdieu and Passeron 2016 and Bourdieu and Passeron 2018).
Since Bourdieu wrote his seminal books and articles, his observations still hold
decades later. These are the conclusions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD): “the more one comes from a disadvantaged background in
France, the less one has a chance to succeed” (OECD 2015, p. 4, own translation). When
comparing these results internationally, the conclusions tend to get worse “insofar the
French system is more inegalitarian than most of the OECD countries” (OECD 2015, p. 3,
own translation). Moreover, this tendency appears to be increasing since 2006 according
to the same report. Such empirical evidence has led this phenomenon to be labeled “The
French meritocratic myth” (André 2013, p. 4). This author further describes this failure
of the French secondary education system to be due to the “relative erosion of the school
system’s ability to mitigate the impact of social origins on school performances” (André
2013, p. 4). Furthermore, the lycées professionnels still bear the stigma of being the incarnation of lesser success compared to their counterparts (lycée général et technologique).
This representation is upheld on all levels of society, most notably when a governmental

Exceptions do exist nevertheless, see for example André 2013 and Berthet and Simon 2014

CHAPTER 7. THE FRENCH SECONDARY SCHOOLING SYSTEM & DATA
COLLECTION
report from 2016 declared that “unsurprisingly, vocational education remains very clearly
the main orientation of the least advantaged social categories” (Paola et al. 2016, p. 14,
own translation, emphasis added). It is worthwhile noting that no context is provided for
this to be no surprise to the authors of this report (no discussion of literature, policy or
historical data to frame this finding). Such comments appear to persist among pupils, and
following the Conseil National d’évaluation du système scolaire (CNESCO as represented
by Paola et al. 2016) is maintained at an institutional level.
This discussion motivated the introduction of specific measures in the first module of
the questionnaire. In module 1 (socio-demographics) were included measures on the level
of education attained and the current job of the respondent’s parents. Moreover, module
6 was entirely dedicated to attempting to subjectively identify (dis)advantages in school
as identified by Bourdieu.
The notion of well-being in school has been introduced in the French educational
system only after 2012, specifically through the explicit mentions of this aspect of schooling
in official documents. Before 2012, the very concept of well-being was reduced to ‘health’
and the ‘practice of sports’ in schools (Thuy Phuong 2016). After this date, numerous
reports and ministerial initiatives have been found to address the question of well-being
within schools.
Several reports are found to be entirely dedicated to well-being within schools in
France. Bacro et al. 2013 use Hierarchical Cluster Analysis combined with multidimensional statistics to determine the impact of well-being on different school outcomes. They
find that the pupil’s well-being in school has an impact to a certain degree of academic performance. In other words, well-being in school is found to positively impact performances
in several taught subjects (such as French), where other subjects are not particularly
concerned (such as mathematics). The authors find nevertheless that sufficient evidence
is found in order to pursue the evaluation of subjective well-being of pupils in school.
Sauneron 2013 confirms the relevance of the usage of subjective data for the measurement of well-being in school. She nevertheless finds that “measuring student well-being
is complex because it mobilizes most often declarative data, therefore subjective data,
which is sensitive to ”social desirability”” (Sauneron 2013, p. 2, own translation). Social
desirability is a behavior in which individuals tend to respond to questions not with their
own, honest opinion, but rather with responses they think the interviewer would consider
socially acceptable. In other words, the respondents tend to keep up appearances for
their interviewer instead of revealing what they actually think. Following this finding,
the questionnaire used in the last chapter of this thesis incorporates a social desirability
scale specifically adapted for younger individuals. This scale is nevertheless not found to
have any significant explanatory power in any of the empirical analyses applied to the
108



7.1. GENERALITIES
data. Such a finding can be easily accounted for in the setup of the questionnaire, since
the entire procedure of answering the questionnaire was done anonymously, without the
intervention of an interviewer. As such, the pupils did not have to ‘pretend’ to any kind of
socially desirable answers. This is further confirmed in the very informal and sometimes
impertinent comments they provided at the very end of the questionnaire.
These reports confirm and consolidate the adopted methodology in the last chapter of
this thesis by acknowledging at an institutional level the coherence of measuring subjective
well-being of pupils in school. Moreover, the usage of both Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
and multidimensional statistics is shown to be a pertinent choice in terms of data analysis
for this inherently multidimensional type of data. Finally, the identification of social
desirability as bias within subjective data (specifically for children) permits a strong
justification for the usage of a social desirability scale in a questionnaire.
Findings on aspirations as underlined by Caroline Hart (Hart 2012, Hart 2016) have
also found a French translation. The study of aspirations has been applied to the specific
French schooling system over time. Dumora 2004 finds that the division of French high
school between collège and lycée particularly shapes aspirations. She identifies that pupils
in collège tend to follow “age group myths” which she also calls “the imaginary without
imagination” (Dumora 2004, p. 258). Such a form of aspirations, specific to the younger
pupils in high school, focuses on a very small amount of stereotyped jobs (doctors, lawyers,
athletes, actors, for example). Dumora explains these “professional fictions” on the one
hand through the fact that these youngest pupils decouple their aspirations from reality
and merely fantasize about their ideal future. This is often linked with the absence of a
complete understanding of the educational requirements and the professional implications
of the job. On the other hand, she finds that the social context of schools tends to reinforce
these professional fictions. Similarly to the results found by Ballet, Biggeri, and Comim
2011, who identify the importance of school as a social environment, Dumora identifies
“peer groups” within schools to reinforce the “conformism of professional fictions”. On
the contrary, starting with pupils from troisième and up, Dumora finds that individuals
tend to move from the space of “possibles” to the space of “probables” (Dumora 1990,
with reference to Bourdieu 1974). Despite the proximity with the capabilitarian vocable,
Dumora has a purely psychological and sociological analysis. Moving from one space
to the other translates the progressive incorporation of the realization of constraints on
their initial aspirations. One of the identified constraints is the diplomas held of the
pupil’s parents. From a broader perspective, the impact of the school environment on the
formation of aspirations has also been discussed in the French context (Dupriez, Monseur,
and Van Campenhoudt 2012). These findings are consistent with those found in a previous
application of the capability approach to the French secondary schooling system (Vos and

Data collection
Sampling

The first thing to note here is the extremely low response rate of schools to have
answered my inquiries. My focus was on the region of “Nouvelle Aquitaine”. As this is a
very vast region (almost 6 million inhabitants for 85 000 km2 ) I chose 2 departments from
which I could easily operate and respond to the specific availability of the schools. The
first department is the Dordogne (rural) and the second the Gironde (more urbanized,
with Bordeaux as it’s capital). After identifying all the schools through the Ministry
of Secondary Education as well as public information on the regional level, I proceeded
to send out letters to each school using the traditional postal service. This resulted in
40 letters to the Dordogne and 57 to the Gironde. I received 1 negative and 3 positive
replies. After a month of non-reply, I proceeded to send the same letter using the school’s
official email account. I received no further replies. I obtained access to one further school
through professional connections in that school, having worked there as an educational
assistant. As such, I had access to 4 schools in total, 2 in the Dordogne and 2 in the
Gironde.
Those schools that were willing to participate did so wholeheartedly, affecting one
of their administrative staff to organize and accompany my presence within the school.
They also allowed me to interview a representative cross-section of the school’s classes,
having always a minima access to one class of each level and in 2 cases I was able to
interview all the pupils from the school.
Despite these setbacks in terms of availability of the data, the sampling roughly
follows a quota technique. With regards to figure 12, and excluding the “formations
professionnelles”, pupils from collège represent 67% of the population for 33% of “lycéens”.
The data collected for this study contains 425 “collégiens” (73%) and 161 “lycéens” (27%).

either. By ensuring their anonymity, the hope was that the pupils would respond as
honestly as possible to the questionnaire, without these honest answers beings used against
them by their parents, teachers or the school’s administration. This has functioned well for
some of them, who become very expressive in their final remarks/suggestions with regards
to the questionnaire. Some pupils disliked the questionnaire particularly commenting that
is was “too long”9 , that there should be “less intimate questions”10 , that it was “loss of
time”11 or simply “0”.
On the other hand, some expressed their incomprehension of the questionnaire, finding it “cool but some questions were hard and weird”12 or considering it to be a “quiz”13
(even though it was a good one).
Others considered it to have “helped” them “to express”14 themselves, to “think”
about their future15 . Finally, most of the pupils did not take time to provide extra
comments and/or remarks, or simply shared their love for their favorite singer or kebab16 .
The following figures give initial and descriptive insight into the collected data. Figure
16 shows a slight over-representation of girls within the interviewees. This does not seem
to be an issue since girls appear to be over-represented in secondary education in France,
especially in lycée (DEPP 2018). The proportionality of girls as being over-represented is
also consistent with the samples used in reports discussed in section 7.1.4.
Figure 17 shows the shares of different age groups among the interviewees. Despite
the percentages being null for ages 10 and 20, it is to be noted that there are 2 individuals
in the former and 1 in the latter case. No interviewee reported the age of 19. Following
figure 18, pupils in collège represent 73% of the respondents whereas the lycéens represent
27%. The larger share of collégiens in the group of respondents is very similar to the share
of collégiens in France globally. This follows the quota sampling as discussed previously.
Figure 19 shows an overview of the attainment of the respondent’s parent’s education.
This figure is presented here as it is to be noted that these levels of education are reported
by the interviewees themselves. This posed a particular problem for the collégiens, who
appeared to often not know what level of education their parents had attained. This was
also the case for their parent’s profession, for which I was very often asked for help (they

did not know how to name their parent’s jobs, and were only able to remotely describe
what they did on a daily basis). As can be seen in this figure, higher education is often
referred to in terms of supplementary years starting at the baccalaureate. The ‘Bac +2’
section refers to a diploma that is no longer delivered in France, since it has integrated the
European standardization incorporating the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS),
adopting the ‘LMD’ (Licence-Master-Doctorat) diploma scheme. The Bac +2 was nevertheless a common diploma previously and is still used in France (Brevet de Technicien
Supérieur, for example).

Finally, figure 20 presents the results of module 2. As further presented in section
8.1.2 this module was not found to be a contributor to the explanatory power of the model
and therefore discarded for further analysis. Nevertheless, pupils, and more specifically
their responses to the questionnaire, may be subject to a form of social desirability.
The existence of social desirability in subjective data has been mentioned by previous
studies as mentioned in section 7.1.4, especially in the specific context of this study. This
figure presents the social desirability on the horizontal axis (ranging from 1 to 47) where
increasing values show a higher degree of ‘socially desirable’ responses. The vertical axis
then presents the number of respondents according to their degree of socially desirable
responses in the module. It is to be noted that this scale is not conceived to be an absolute
measure, but rather a relative one. The results may thus only be compared among one
another and are not to be considered as an absolute scale.
The non-significance of this measure can be explained by several factors. First of
all, as shown in figure 20, the degree of socially desirable answers follow a quasi-normal
distribution. As such, pupils may be considered to have normally distributed degrees of
socially desirable responses. Furthermore, the methodology which was used to collect
the answers inherently eliminates a considerable part of the eventual provenance of social desirability in answers. This social desirability comes from the fact that responses
are provided to an interviewer, in which case the interviewee will display social desirable
answers. As the responses were collected via a computer, with minimal intervention of
114



7.2. DATA COLLECTION
the interviewers, this tendency is at least partially eliminated. Finally, the tendency to
not socially desirable answers is confirmed by some of the observations discussed at the
beginning of this section. When asked for commentaries and remarks on the questionnaires, besides the occasional compliment, respondents tended to display remarks which
were either completely out of context, impertinent or highly critical of the questionnaire.
Such remarks point to a certain extent to the fact that answers were provided on a highly
personal basis, disregarding the opinion the interviewer would have of those respondents.
For these reasons, this social desirability scale is discarded in further analyses.

Methodological Strategy

his section presents the methodology that resulted in the construction of the questionnaire, which in turn was then submitted to the pupils to respond to. The questionnaire, more precisely the module on aspirations, was constructed entirely based upon the
results of the previously held focus groups. The remaining parts of the questionnaire were
ad hoc and based upon the existing literature. The strategy is a mixture of both qualitative and quantitative data gathering. In the same manner, the data will be analyzed
qualitatively and quantitatively. As such, it follows the recommendation by Caroline Hart
when she considers that when applying the capability approach “a pluralistic approach is
required that draws on both qualitative and quantitative methods” (Hart 2009, p. 399).

Gathering the Data, results of the Focus Groups

In order to construct the questionnaire, but also to explain clearly my methodology to
the interviewees, I organized focus groups including all the pupils who would later respond
to the questionnaire. A similar methodology can be found in studies such as Biggeri et al.
2006 and Hart 2012. These focus groups thus had a double objective; on the one hand, it
117



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
allowed me to get familiarized with the school, the pupils, but also the teachers, the staff
and specifically the person who would accompany me while I was present in the school.
On the other hand, it would further allow me to identify the aspirations that the pupils
linked to school, whether their schooling was a positive or a negative contributor to these
aspirations.
Furthermore, having focus groups with the pupils before letting them respond to the
questionnaire allowed them to reflect on the questionnaire beforehand. These focus groups
highlighted in many cases the fact that the pupils had not previously thought about some
of the questions that were discussed. This has been noted previously by Hart: “the
young people’s explanations of how they went about making plans for the future were
fragmented, messy and even contradictory at times. Thus it was difficult to tease out a
hierarchical set of factors that influenced an individual’s choices.” (Hart 2011b, p. 19).
Since a certain time elapsed between the initial focus groups and the filling out of the
questionnaire, the hope is that the respondents reflected further on these questions to
better form their opinion about them.
The initial objective was to have the focus groups without the presence of any other
adult (teachers or educational assistants, for example) in the room, as I was able to obtain
in a previous study (Vos and Ballet 2018). Due to increasingly strict regulations, having
no professional nor personal connections in the surveyed schools, this was not possible.
I would nevertheless discuss in advance my methodology with the school representative
that would accompany me. These individuals were most comprehensive and collaborative,
and after introducing me to the class would make sure not to intervene any further.
Each focus group was constituted of an entire regular class and lasted for one hour
every time. In a first instance, I would take time to present myself, my reason for taking
an hour of their time and the objective of the focus group. In a second phase, the objective
was to spark a debate between the pupils, without any further intervention from me nor
the person who would accompany me1 . In order to trigger the debate in the focus group,
the following questions were asked:
Q1 – “Is school important to you, and why?”
Q2 – “Do you think that coming to school is going to change your future, and how?”
Q3 – “Do you think that coming to school stops you from doing what you want?”
Q4 – “What things are you unable to do by coming to school?”

8.1. METHODOLOGICAL STRATEGY
The first and second questions are skewed to identify the “positive” outcome of
school, in the pupil’s opinions. They allowed to initiate the debate, but this would very
often end rather quickly. The third and fourth questions are intended to relaunch the
discussions and capture the exact opposite and contrary to Q1 and Q2. This worked very
well in the vast majority of the focus groups and these latter two questions would result in
much more animated suggestions. This freedom of speech among peers, without any given
direction from adults, resulted in rich discussions. Q3 and Q4 would typically result in the
boldest of the class to declare that school is indeed a major hindrance to their freedom.
Specifically, Q4 would result in a wide variety of activities the pupils would rather do that
coming to school2 . As the discussion progressed, and still without my intervention, they
would very soon realize that had they never come to school, or if they stopped doing so,
they would have never met the friend they intended to do all these activities with. This
is where the discussion became particularly productive for all the benefits they identified
in going to school. As can be seen in the tag cloud I constructed after these focus groups
(figure 21), themes such as “amis” (friends), “communauté” (community), “social”, and
“recontres” (encounters) occupy an important place. The realization that school was their
major, and sometimes only, place of socialization, allowed the discussion to further evolve
towards benefits of school.
The tag cloud in figure 21 is not intended to translate any kind of solid material for
analysis, but I used it mainly when schools invited me to account for my research. This
was the case for 2 schools, who wished to preview the outcomes of the focus groups, mainly
for those teachers and staff who were not involved during my presence in the school. It
is to be noted that the size of the words is not always representative of its frequency of
occurrence during the discussion. Shorter words tend to be oversize with regards to the
number of actual times it was used by pupils.
Since I attempted to intervene only during the focus groups when discussions flattened
out, I took notes the rest of the time, counting the specific phrasings and themes the pupils
would discuss. The tag cloud is the result of this counting, representing the frequency at
which the words were used in the discussions. It regroups all the open classes I held for
this research.
The outcomes of the focus groups provided for the construction of one of the modules
of the questionnaire but also composes an interesting starting point for the analysis. In
line with Sen’s idea of public debate and reasoning, the focus groups allowed to select
the capabilities – in this case, future-oriented ones in the shape of aspirations – which
appeared relevant to the observed population of pupils. Furthermore, and following the
2
The activities ranged from doing absolutely nothing to jet-skying on a nearby river, most often
accompanied by their friends.

8.1. METHODOLOGICAL STRATEGY
strategies of application of the capability approach as outlined by Brandolini and D’Alessio
1998, these focus groups allow for an initial “item-by-item analysis” as a supplementation
strategy.
The first comparison that can be made is to view whether the identified dimensions
are consistent with the existent literature. First of all, these focus groups allowed the
identification of a vast majority of the list established by Martha Nussbaum (Nussbaum
2003). The items on Nussbaum’s list are nevertheless very generic, whereas the impacts
of school – both positive and negative – identified by the focus groups were more specific. As such, “Life” from Nussbaum’s list translated into specifics such as having a job
(with a decent salary), having a home, or learning about hygiene. The item of “Bodily
Health” was also largely discussed, where health outcomes were directly related to school
(specifically biology classes). “Bodily Integrity” appears to have been the major absent of
the capabilities identified by the participants. “Senses, Imagination and Thought” may
have been the most frequent occurrences of themes in the focus groups; pupils would
systematically underline the importance of school in their learning process, allowing them
to reason individually and independently. They would also stress the cultural and artistic
knowledge school provides. “Emotions” has not been cited as such, even though it may
overlap with the seventh item of “Affiliation”. The only emotions that pupils would mention are those of “pleasure”, “feeling lost” or sadness related to “bullying” which they
associate with school. “Practical Reason” has been vastly discussed as they find school to
allow them to “reason”, to “think”, to “learn” and to “know” about new things. “Play”
is also a less represented item from the focus groups, even though it has not been omitted entirely, with references to be able to practice “sports” and to join “clubs” withing
school. Finally, “Control Over One’s Environment” both politically and materially has
been identified as important by the respondents. “Participation”, “hierarchy” and “citizenship” were mentioned with reference to political participation and having a “house”,
a “salary” and “money” in general were found important outcomes of school.
The methodology of organizing focus groups for children while applying the capability approach has been applied previously (Biggeri et al. 2006, drawing on “Capability
approach and child well-being”, Hart 2012). When comparing the outcomes of the focus
groups to these studies, the overlap is initially less clear. Hart focuses on determinants of
the specific aspiration formation of entering higher education, or hindrance thereof, and
does therefore not specify a list of educational aspirations. Biggeri finds a compounded
list of 14 elements relating capabilities that appear pertinent for children. The outcomes
of the focus groups do overlap largely with the list proposed by Biggeri. Out of the 14
elements, at least 12 are identified by the focus groups. The remaining 2 elements appear
to be highly specific to the individuals interviewed in the study proposed by Biggeri et al.

121



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
2006. “Bodily integrity and safety”, similar to the item from Nussbaum’s list, was not
identified during the focus groups. This can be due either to the absence of any feeling
of physical threat or because it would be a difficult subject to discuss with an external
observer, let alone in front of their entire class. Furthermore, the eighth item on Biggeri’s
list, namely “Freedom from economic and non-economic exploitation” was also not mentioned during the focus groups. Similarly, this can be due to the absence of the feel of
concern about this subject or a non-willingness to discuss it. Such an item appears to
be highly specific to the group of children that was observed during the study by Biggeri
et al. 2006, since it was held during the “Children’s World Congress on Child Labour”,
in Florence in May 2004. In contrast, it is highly unlikely that children who responded
to the questionnaire for this thesis were concerned by child labor.
These results support Sen’s view of the importance of participation and deliberation
as being essential to the correct framing of capabilities (or aspirations) when studying
specific groups. On the other hand, it also suggests that some items may be omitted due
to the non-willingness of participants to discuss specific subjects during public debates.
Such a reluctance to discuss some specifics is not necessarily due to an absence of interest
or because an individual finds it non-pertinent, but rather because the discussion of the
topic may be uncomfortable or embarrassing. Similarly, the subject of sexuality was only
very rarely discussed during these focus groups, despite most of the schools I worked in
having specific classes on sexuality education. Every single time it was actually discussed,
it was rather to provoke a reaction either from other pupils or from me. As such, relying
solely on participation and public debate may present flaws and result in an incomplete
list of items.

8.1.2

Construction of the Questionnaire

The questionnaire was entirely constructed online. This comes with both benefits
and drawbacks. It implied that all schools would require to have sufficient computers
and internet access to allow classes to respond to the questionnaire. This has resulted
in a more complex organization of the sessions during which the pupils could fill out the
questionnaire. It also required to take time to explain the location and procedure to the
students prior to them filling out the questionnaire. This has proven to pose difficulties
in some cases. Notably the difficulty to communicate the (complex) link to the pupils.
Moreover, not all the pupils felt at ease with the tool that was used. Here again, the
schools were highly implicated, in providing both the computers and staff to provide
assistance to the pupils who required it. Finally, this questionnaire being online, it posed
a security issue. Anyone could navigate to the questionnaire and fill it out as many times
122



8.1. METHODOLOGICAL STRATEGY
as they wanted. To counter this, the questionnaire was protected with a password, taken
down between sessions and all the provided answers provided with a timestamp.
A major advantage of using an online questionnaire was to entirely eliminate missing
or irrelevant answers. This tool allowed to predetermine the “shape” some answers could
take and a considerable amount of time was dedicated to predetermining and eliminating
irrelevant answers. These irrelevant answers encompass for example pupils attempting
to respond to anything else than a natural number, or an excessively large number when
their age is asked. Evaluative questions exclusively used a Likert scale, which excludes the
possibility to answer “I do not know” (Likert 1932). As some pupils would have preferred
to have this option3 , some would forcibly do so. The usage of this online tool permitted
to avoid these answers.
The questionnaire itself was composed of 8 modules, which were not identified as
such to the respondent. The first 7 modules were determined ad hoc and the content of
the final module was determined after the focus groups.
The socio-demographic section contained items on age, gender, nationality, and family
among others. The items related to family attempted to identify the respondent’s family
composition (number of siblings) and the socio-professional background of the parents
(level of education attained, current job).
The Social Desirability Scale attempted to identify the degree to which the respondent
filled out the questionnaire in a way she/he found socially correct or acceptable. It is
composed of twenty CSD items from the Crowne-Marlowe scale for adults which were
rephrased in simpler language for children. The remaining items were specially constructed to sample a wide range of social experiences common to school-age children.
The possibility of acquiescence response sets was minimized by keying 26 of the 48 items
so that the interviewee must respond “true” and 22 so that she/he must respond “false”
to appear socially acceptable (Crandall, Crandall, and Katkovsky 1965). Upon further
analysis (section 8.2) it was found to be noncontributing to either of the axes. Using
this item in further empirical analysis (section 8.2.3) appeared to be challenging as there
exists no literature which relates the usage of this measure and is beyond the scope of the
determination of contributing factors to school-related aspirations.
Module 3 attempted to identify the pupil’s well-being in school and was very largely based
on a study with a similar methodology (Hart 2012). The questions used for this module
are my own translation of their English version provided by Caroline Hart.

Modules 4 and 5 invited the respondent to give their opinion on the importance, but also
the quality of the school they attended.
Module 6 attempted to subjectively evaluate Bourdieu and Passeron’s statistical findings
on the (non-)diversity of social classes in higher education. In other words, this module
asked the pupil whether she/he considered being (dis)advantaged in comparison to their
peers because of their parents being more or less rich, having attained a certain level of
education or because their parents were more or less involved in their education.
Module 7 takes the previously identified registers of aspiration formation with regards
to higher education by Hart 2011b. It transforms these registers into question about
“further education” rather than higher education as they were initially intended by the
author. This allows these findings to be applied to pupils from collège in making them
more generic.
The module on Aspirations and Agency attempts to identify the degree to which the
pupils find their decisions and aspirations in conflict with those of their peers, their
parents, and their teachers. It also focuses on their feeling of autonomy in their decision
making regarding their schooling and the formulation of their aspirations.
Finally, module 9 was entirely constructed as discussed in section 8.1.1, using only the
aspirations identified to be pertinent by the pupils during the focus groups. It then
formulated the question “I think that my schooling will allow me to...” followed by the
aspirations discussed during the focus groups.

8.2. DATA ANALYSIS

8.2.1

Data Analysis
Identification of the Correspondences; Multiple Correspondences Analysis

Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is part of the larger family of correspondence analysis. This body of inductive statistical methods may be attributed to the
French statistician, Jean-Paul Benzécri. This model has been chosen for the analysis of
the previously collected data following the epigraph of this chapter, where Benzécri affirms that “the model must follow the data, not the other way around!” (Benzécri 1976,
own translation). Such a claim starkly contrasts with the more “traditional” econometric
approach to data analysis in economic science. In this latter approach, data analyzed
using a predetermined model, notably defining influencing factors ex ante, rather than
allowing the data to structure itself. Regarding the corpus of correspondence analysis,
Benzécri finds that “when our experience was applied to various types of data, it allows
identifying models, not a priori but a posteriori [. . . ] without any restrictive hypotheses.”
(Benzécri 1977b, p. 19, own translation). Following this statement, applying an MCA to
the collected survey data will allow identifying complex relationships between the different dimensions, i.e. modules, of the questionnaire, without presupposing any exiting
relation. The application of such a technique is consistent and coherent when applied to a
database specifically constructed for capabilitarian analysis as discussed in section 5.2.3.
As noted by Schokkaert and Van Ootegem 1990, it is to be noted nevertheless that such
a technique may yield “useful identification” while remembering that it is a mere “data
reduction technique” which only “summarizes the information contained in the original
questionnaire” (Schokkaert and Van Ootegem 1990, p. 439). In order to consolidate its
findings, I will therefore further complete it with other empirical strategies.
I ran multiple iterations of the MCA over different forms of the entire database. Initially, using the entire database, only less than 12% of the inertia was explained with the
first 2 axes, indicating too many or too blurry relationships were established using the
entirety of the data. The following iterations consisted of removing those questions that
were not found to significantly contribute to the explained inertia of the axes. As previously stated, the removed dimensions were notably the entirety of the Social Desirability
Scale, but also various socio-demographic indicators. The indicators included nationality
(both of the pupil and parents), parent’s marital status, and the pupil’s school. The
retained criterion for establishing the threshold of significance of contribution to an axis
was that the contribution of a modality had to exceed the average contribution of all
modalities to the entire axis.

Figure 22: Multiple Cluster Analysis Scree Plot

Other dimensions, even though they did not contribute significantly to the determination of an axis, were forcefully kept in the MCA. This occurred notably for the number
of siblings and the subjective evaluation of the (dis)advantages à la Bourdieu. The reason for doing so was that removing them would consist of entirely denying well-anchored
aspects of the literature discussed previously.
As a result of these iterations, the final MCA was applied to 85 questions and all of the
586 respondents. The fact that all of the respondents could be used was very largely due
to the usage of an online questionnaire, avoiding pitfalls discussed in section 8.1.2. Figure
22 shows the scree plot resulted from the final MCA. The very large number of axes (157
contribute to the explained inertia) makes the visualization difficult, which is why only
the 25 first axes are represented on the scree plot, allowing to draw some information from
the visual representation. The first two axes contribute 54,37% to the explained inertia.
It is to be noted that this is a 20% increase in comparison to my previous study (Vos
and Ballet 2018). The contribution of the third axis drops to 6,73% and the analysis of
further axes is therefore discarded. The symmetrical graph of the variables resulting from
the MCA can be found in appendix K. This appendix only represents the positioning of
the variables as individuals cannot be directly analyzed in an MCA.
The following tables (6 to 18) present the results of the MCA. The selection of the
dimensions (questions) is based upon the previously exposed criterion. This criterion of
selection requires a modality to contribute strictly more than the average contribution
of all the modalities to the axis’ inertia. Once the significant contributors identified,
they were then placed in either of the following tables according to their axis and sign
(positive or negative). It is to be noted that the order of appearance of the questions
126



8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
has no importance and merely reflects the order of appearance of the dimension in the
questionnaire.
This analysis is much more conclusive than the similar previous one (Vos and Ballet
2018). The axes are more clearly distinguishable, which may be imputed to the considerably higher number of respondents to the questionnaire. These results are nevertheless
to be taken with precaution, as should any statistical result. For instance, the presence
of age 10 on axis F2 on the positive side (table 15) may be considered to be an outlier,
as only 2 individuals reported the age of 10 in the entire panel of respondents. Furthermore, this presents a drawback in comparison to our previous study, as it does not clearly
identify any age groups to be assimilated to either of the axes. We previously found that
the level of aspirations, well-being in school and subjective evaluation of school tended to
decrease while age increased. This is not the case in this application as only one age is
found to contribute significantly to the elaboration of an axis, and this reported age is an
outlier.
The axes being defined statistically, the MCA allows identifying the conceptual meaning of each of these axes. Once again, this statistical application appears highly conclusive
as this identification is relatively clear-cut, specifically with regards to our previous study.
The more blurry results of this initial study (Vos and Ballet 2018) have been it’s most
prominent weakness, and has been pointed out, notably during a presentation at the first
Cambridge Capability Approach Conference held in June 2016. Despite these results not
being perfectly partitioned, the axes may be defined as follows.
Firstly, the first axis (F1) regroups on its negative side modalities ranging from 3 to
6, thus hovering around the ‘average’ of 4 (as shown in tables 6 and 7). The positive side
of this axis is the most clear-cut of all, with exclusively the highest modality of 7 (tables
8, 9, 10, and 11), thus providing this axis with it’s label of ‘positiveness’. In other words,
the first axis, specifically the positive side, appears to regroup modalities on the high end
from all modules of the questionnaire.
This axis also shows that more aspirations are found to significantly contribute to its
constitution. The positive side of this axis is co-constituted by the aspiration of political
participation, which is not identified in the second axis. Moreover, a wider variety of the
school’s staff is found to be aiding in the pupil’s schooling.
Secondly, the negative side of the second axis (tables 12, 13, and 14) is almost as
precise as the positive side of axis F1. It regroups only the modality 6, with the exception
of one single 5. This side of the second axis, therefore, represents the high-end, very much
above average. The positive side of this second axis (tables 15, 16, 17, and 18) presents

127



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
a highly ‘pessimistic’ view of schooling, well-being therein, it’s quality and the associated
aspirations. As this axis will show, this also translates into a negative, if not hostile,
behavior of pupils towards school. First off, the dimension of age (with the associated
modality of 10) is discarded as they are embodied by only 2 individuals out of the total
586 respondents. The predominant modality that contributes to the elaboration of this
axis is that of 1. This modality is frequently accompanied by 2 and to a lesser extent
by 3 or 4. Distributed over a vast majority of the modules of the questionnaire, this
indicates that for those pupils who consider the quality of their school poorly, they tend
to experience low levels of well-being in school as well as extremely low school-related
aspirations.
The positive side of the second axis also occasionally identifies the highest modalities in very specific dimensions. Upon further exploration, it may be noted that these
high modalities correspond to ‘negative’ dimensions, thus translating a negative attitude
towards school, such as skipping classes frequently or considering to entirely stop coming
to school. Another illustration of these sparse high modalities is that of the feeling that
personal aspirations clash with those formulated by teachers in the pupil’s stead. One
particular dimension, that is only present on this axis, is that of further education. It
is associated with the lowest modality which translates into “when thinking about my
future schooling, I think that I will not succeed”. This dimension translates a feeling of
(imminent) failure of the pupil in the schooling system.
Finally, it is to be noted that there exists a general consistency in the grouping of the
modalities. This may be considered as the most important result of this MCA. Without
claiming the identification of a causal link, a clear correspondence is established between
the modules in the questionnaire. Even though not every modality of every question is
represented significantly, there is a general presence of all the modules in the definition of
the two axes. I will further confirm this finding with the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis in
the following section, which aims to complete this initial clustering method.

the coordinates of the same variables on the retained axes. This section will then apply
Benzécri’s recommendation to complete the MCA with a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
(HCA). He finds that “it is beyond doubt that, in any study using discrimination and
based upon multidimensional data, that a factorial analysis must precede a hierarchical
cluster analysis” (Benzécri 1977a, p. 404, own translation). More specifically, this HCA
141



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
is applied to the coordinates of the variables resulting from the MCA. In other words, the
HCA groups variables into classes based on the euclidean distances previously determined.
It is to be noted that the amount of classes is not defined ad hoc. As such, and similarly
to the MCA, this method does not require a predetermined model and thus, no subjective
view on behalf of the researcher.
As tables 19 to 28 show, the HCA identified 3 distinct clusters of variables. These
groupings appear to confirm the initial findings from the MCA.
The first group may be labeled similarly to axis F2. It appears to classify all the low
to extremely low modalities as belonging to the same group, which may then be called
the ‘pessimists’. The vast majority of the dimensions are characterized by the modality
1. There is also a frequent appearance of modalities 2 and 3 in a lesser measure. Once
again, this group is coupled with some modalities 7, which relate the ‘hostile’ attitude of
the pupil to school. More specifically they refer to dimensions such as skipping classes
and having considered stopping school entirely. Furthermore, this HCA also associates
the non-willingness of these pupils to pursue schooling. The addition of this analysis to
the previous MCA is the translation of a very low feeling of agency from the pupils. When
asked whether the students think that they can “independently decide about [their] aspirations”, they find none of the proposed dimensions to be relevant. In other words, they
do not experience any form of autonomy in their aspirations concerning their education,
career or social interactions. Similarly to the previous finding, they couple this with extremely low modalities of their aspirations. The importance of the experience of agency
with regards to schooling is found to be a major factor in the model that is exposed in
section 8.2.3.
Secondly comes the group which may be labeled as ‘positive’. This group confirms
once more the findings of the MCA as it associates high levels of well-being in school with
the feeling pupils can bring about change and express themselves on their aspirations.
These dimensions are coupled with a very positive evaluation of the quality of the school’s
staff (both pedagogical and non-pedagogical), but also the usefulness of school and the
aspirations they consider increasing from attending school. Some discrepancies are to be
noted with the sporadic appearance of the modality 1. They appear to be directly linked
to some of the non-pedagogical staff of their school, more specifically the CPE and the
COP (career guidance counselor). This mildly attenuates the clear-cut definition of this
positive group.
The issue of the COPs is something that has been informally reported to me while
I was present in some of the schools. The most likely explanation for the association of
the modality 1 with the COPs is that some students never actually meet them. Most of
142



8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
the schools do not oblige their pupils to meet with the COP. Moreover, for those students
who do wish to do so, this may prove to be a challenge due to their extremely rare
actual presence within the schools. Several pupils have told me, informally, about the
poor organization around meeting the COP. The specific issue of the CPE is much more
difficult to account for. These individuals are present at school at all times, and in schools
housing larger numbers of pupils, there may even be more than one at a time. To my
knowledge, the largest school in Nouvelle-Aquitaine (considering the number of pupils)
has up to 4 CPEs present simultaneously. The poor evaluation some pupils give of their
CPEs may then be explained by the fact that these individuals do not have a harmonized
role across schools as they do not have any actual obligations towards students (teaching
classes or even receiving them in their offices, for example). Where some may decide to
actively engage with pupils, some may be more discreet and therefore perceived as absent
by their pupils.
This second group also presents a result that will be found again in the model that
is presented in section 8.2.3, namely the fact that the respondents in this group identify
simultaneously very high aspirations related to school and high levels of conflicting aspirations. Several elements may nevertheless be invoked to explain such a result. First,
this group is also the group of individuals who report the highest levels of feeling of independence in the formation of their aspirations. As such they may consider that what
they want conflicts with what other people want for them, but that they still have the
ability to achieve their aspirations independently of the willing of others. Secondly, the
aspirations of module 9 were modalities related to school exclusively. As the conflicting
aspirations relate to people outside of school, the pupils may identify school as a parallel
vector through which they may maintain and even further develop their aspirations. I
will further develop these arguments in the following section.
The final group is that constituted of ‘moderate’ modalities, and regroups only modalities ‘in the middle’, ranging from 3 to 6 with very rare occurrences of 2. This group is
the most difficult to interpret as there are no extreme values associated with it. What
can be said about it is that it confirms the consistency of the conclusions found in the
previous groups. Moreover, it once more shows that there appears to be a link between
the different modules of the questionnaire, and thus the themes explored throughout this
study. This consistency reinforced the conclusions found through the MCA. The formation of such groups does not imply any form of causality but confirms the existence of
linkages between the different modules in the questionnaire.
The fact that the HCA applied to the MCA identifies highly consistent groups is
therefore in line with the theoretical literature as well as the specific applications to the
French schooling system. As discussed in section 7.1.4, the studies relating to the different
143



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
impacts of well-being and aspirations on schooling are confirmed to a certain extent in
the empirical application performed here. Even though this study does not identify the
evolution over time of aspirations (such as highlighted by Dumora 2004 and Vos and Ballet
2018), it does show that aspirations are related to the feeling of well-being in school. This
feeling of well-being has been declined in multiple forms in the questionnaire. It spans over
dimensions of well-being relating to peers, as well as the (non-)educational staff in school.
The ability to participate, the feeling that school provides a good working environment,
as well as the subjective importance of school, are also found to influence school-related
aspirations. It appears therefore that the usage of this questionnaire is consistent with
findings of reports and both theoretical and empirical findings on the French secondary
educational system.

Further comparisons; identifying group characteristics

In the previous multiple cluster analysis, no socio-demographic values were found to
significantly contribute to the constitution of the first two axes. It did nevertheless allow
for strong evidence that points at existing linkages between the dimensions of education,
well-being, and aspirations. The absence of proper identification (i.e. characterization of
the individuals within the groups) constitutes a flaw of the MCA presented here. This
section will then attempt to attach further characteristics to the previously identified
groups. In order to shed light on the second and third research questions proposed in the
introduction, two methods will be combined. First of all, a comparison of the Chi-Squared
(χ2 ) between socio-demographic elements and the dimensions that were found pertinent
by the MCA will be proposed. Secondly, a logistic regression will be proposed to quantify
the impact of the dimensions on the formation of aspirations within school.

8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
Before proposing the following results, I have removed the 3 outliers from the data,
namely the two individuals who reported the age of 10 and the one individual who reported
the age of 20. Specifically, the individuals of 10 would have greatly influenced the logistic
regression as their modality would have been the base modality, drawing as such a lot of
attention to them out of the total 586. This leaves 583 individuals for further analysis.

Table 29: χ2 of school related aspirations and socio-demographic characteristics

Table 29 shows the Degrees of Freedom (DF), Pearson’s Chi-Squared (χ2 ) and the
associated p-value of the different components of the first module of the questionnaire in
relation to the average school-related aspirations. This latter average is calculated as the
rounded average of all the items in the last module (module 9) of the questionnaire and
therefore ranges from 1 to 7, similarly to the adopted Likert scale for the rest of the questionnaire. It thus attempts to capture an aggregate measure of all the aspirations which
the pupils have found important in relation to school. As these aspirations have been determined through focus groups (as opposed to the ad hoc and literature-based modules)
this aggregated measure pertinently represents the level of aspirations the respondents
have with regards to school. It may be translated as the overall level of school-related
aspirations for each respondent.
Table 29 therefore shows a predominant absence of relation between socio-demographic
indicators and school-related aspirations. Significance is considered to be achieved for
each p-value equal or inferior to .05. This confirms the results obtained from the MCA
discussed in a previous section, where none of the indicators were found to significantly
contribute to the determination of the axes. The gender, the parent’s attained level of
education, the job of parent B and the number of siblings do not appear to be determining
factors of the formation of shool related aspirations in this data set.
The only exceptions found here are the respondent’s age on the one hand and the job
of parent “A” on the other. Parent A and B did not refer to either of the parents specifically in the questionnaire, notably the gender of the parent. This presents the strength
of allowing the respondent to report their parents as being a homo- or a heterosexual
155



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
couple. This also allows to bypass the distinction between “mother” and “father”, and
lets the respondent decide, consciously or unconsciously, to report the parent which may
impact them most first. This appears to have been the case, where the job of parent A
has a significant impact on the formation of the respondent’s aspirations whereas the job
of parent B does not.
In order to identify the job of the respondent’s parents, they were given the most
disaggregated form of jobs as provided by the INSEE6 . This allowed them to more easily
identify their parent’s jobs. It is to be noted that this was the question the pupils had the
most difficulty with. Especially children in collèges often asked for help in identifying the
jobs of their parents in the provided list. For further study, this list was then transformed
into the most aggregated scale provided by the INSEE. As such, this aggregation was
the same as used by Bourdieu and Passeron 2016 and one level higher than that used by
Bourdieu 2016. As such, the job of the parent the respondent reported first appears to
have a link to the formation of the pupil’s school-related aspirations, whereas the job of
the other does not.
Furthermore, a significant relationship between age and aspirations is identified,
which confirms previous findings on the impact of age on the formation and transformation of aspirations (Hart 2012, Vos and Ballet 2018). Such a result may be due to a
variety of factors, even though they appear “complex and difficult to explain” (Hart 2012,
p. 83). Hart finds three major components affecting the change of aspirations, namely
“family aspirations and restrictions”, “interviewees’ perception of their subject ability at
school or college, their examination results and their perceived aptitude for particular
careers” and finally “work experience opportunities” (Hart 2012, p. 83). This is furthermore highly consistent with the idea of dynamic and especially evolving capabilities as
discussed previously. Neither of the two previous results does indicate in which direction
or manner age and job of parent A affect the shaping of aspirations. This will be further
explored in the logistic regression proposed at the end of this section.
To contrast these results, table 30 shows that subjective measures of parent’s jobs
and the attained level of education do have a significant relation to school-related aspirations. Module 6, relating subjective (dis)advantages “à la Bourdieu”, includes items that
attempt to account for the manner in which the respondent perceives the (dis)advantages
they benefit of/suffer from. More specifically they attempt to measure whether the pupils
feel (dis)advantaged due to their parent’s education and/or financial capital. This is an
interesting finding on itself as it shows the importance of the manner pupils perceive their
parent’s jobs rather than their parent’s actual jobs. This correlates with the idea that is
6

8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
developed by Hart (Hart 2011b), where internal registers play a predominant role in the
determination of higher education aspirations. This makes the finding consistent with
existing literature; although it alters the canal through which parent’s socio-professional
status affects their child’s educational aspirations. In other words, it is not directly the
job or the wealth detained by the pupil’s parents, but rather the way in which she or he
feels that it affects them in their schooling experience.

Table 30: χ2 of school related aspirations and modules from questionnaire

Starkly contrasting with the results from table 29, table 30 finds a vast majority of
the dimensions measured in the questionnaire to affect the level of educational aspirations
with high levels of significance. All these dimensions are measured as rounded averages of
the corresponding modules, and thus attempt to translate an aggregated measure of their
corresponding modules. Module 4 attempts to measure the importance the respondents
attach to their own school. It includes items which ask the pupils whether they consider
obtaining their diploma important and whether this same diploma will be useful for them
in the future. Furthermore, it contains an item that attempts to measure the subjective
importance attached to the knowledge they will acquire in school.
Module 5 has been broken up for measurement in order to distinguish between the different
types of staff present in school. On the one hand, the subjective importance and “quality”
of the teachers are measured. It more specifically asks about the pedagogy of the teachers,
and whether the pupils find that their teachers would help them globally in their schooling.
The section of module 5, relating the contribution of further educational staff consisted of
similar questions but with regards to the CPE and educational assistants. The specifics
of module 6 have been discussed prior to table 30.
Module 7 attempts to relate the internal register to further education, as proposed by
157



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
Hart 2011b. It was composed of items that asked the respondent to project herself into
“future schooling” and to choose between 1 of 5 propositions. These propositions focused
on identifying whether the pupil feels like she or he would “be able to succeed”, “fit in”,
“feel at ease in the environment”, for example.
Module 8, which attempted to measure aspiration agency overall was decomposed in
four different sections. Globally the section aimed at measuring the feeling of agency of
different levels. The first and second sections of this module asked if the respondent felt
like she or he could “talk about [my] aspirations with...”. The first section then related
to a variety of actors in school, like teachers, the CPE and the career guidance counselor
for example. The second section asked the same question for individuals outside school,
such as parents, siblings and girl/boyfriend. The latter section than particularly relates
to those Hart describes as the “significant others” who play a particularly strong role
on the emotional level and in the decision making, specifically regarding the formation
of aspirations. The third section in this module focuses specifically on the autonomy
of choice. Items in this module started with “I think that I can independently decide
about my aspirations concerning...”. The propositions of aspirations were based on the
focus groups and therefore correlate with exiting literature (see for example “Capability
approach and child well-being” and Biggeri et al. 2006). Finally, the last section of module
8 provided a measure for conflicting aspirations. Items in this section were questions under
the form of “I think that my aspirations are in conflict with what X wants for my future”,
where X was replaced with the respondent’s significant others.
With the exception of the internal registers to further education, all modules (and
the derived sections) were found to be significantly linked to the shaping of pupil’s schoolrelated aspirations. These χ2 tests, therefore, present further evidence to corroborate the
existing literature on the determinants of aspirations. New findings in comparison to
the previously proposed MCA and HCA are the more specific focus on determinants on
educational aspirations. Using the χ2 , the bilateral relationship between the presented
modules, as well as some socio-demographic measures are highlighted.
These tests do nevertheless not present any direction or magnitude for these impacts.
To deepen and further specify these relations ships, I will propose a logistic regression
model, specifically for an ordinal dependent variable. The explained variable is a qualitative ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 7 (following a Likert scale). This variable remains
unchanged in comparison to the previous bilateral relationships and is the aggregated
score of the respondents school-related aspirations. The independent variables are a mixture of one quantitative variable – age – and four ordinal variables ranging also from 1 to
7. An exception here is the “Subjective (dis)advantages à la Bourdieu” which ranges from
0 to 4. In order to keep the related questions neutral and did therefore not follow a Likert
158



8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
scale but were items to which the respondent had to answer with yes or no. The aggregated version used here is a sum of the 4 items, in order to capture the degree to which
the individual agreed with the proposed statements overall. It is therefore not a measure
of whether the respondent is advantaged or disadvantaged in the sense of Bourdieu, but
she or he feels like the situation of her or his parent may induce these (dis)advantages.
This measure, therefore, designates the inner register of aspiration formation rather than
the actual levels of education, financial wealth and support of the respondent’s parents.
The variety of the variables, as well as the ordinal nature of the dependent variable
call for a specific model, namely an ordinal logistic regression. Such a model will allow
fitting the data obtained from the questionnaire best, following Wooldridge 2010, p. 504,
who finds that: “if y is an ordered response, then the values we assign to each outcome
are no longer arbitrary”. Thus, a multinomial or dichotomous logistic regression could
also have been used, but these do not make use of the fact that the dependent variable of
this model is ordered by nature, as suggested by Wooldridge. In other words, this model
allows taking advantage of the fact that when a respondent has an aggregated score of 2
on school aspirations this individual has a qualitatively higher level of aspiration than an
individual who has a level of 1.
The logistic ordinal model may be formalized as follows:

logit(P (Y ≤ j)) = log

P (Y ≤ j)
P (Y > j)

(8.1)

where Y is an ordinal outcome with J modalities,
with j = 1, ... , J - 1
and where P(Y ≤ j) is the cumulative probability of Y less than or equal to a specific
modality j
From here follows the model, which may be written as:

logit(P (Y ≤ j)) = βj + α1 x1 + ... + αp xp

(8.2)

where β j is the intercept of the j th modality
where αp is the coefficient of the pth variable
This specification only allows to account for a ‘binary’ comparison of probabilities of
159



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
the outcome variable. In other words, the ratio logit(P(Y ≤ j)) (equation 31) accounts for
the ratio between the probability of having a level of aspirations inferior or equal to j and
having a level of aspirations strictly superior to j. The entirety of the model is, therefore,
a set of J binary models as specified in equations 31 and 32 (7 levels of aspirations in this
case). In order to estimate parameters α and β, the likelihood function is then maximized
over all of the J binary models. The model’s parameters are presented in tables 33 and
34. In order to obtain this final model, it has undergone multiple iterations in order to
select and retain only those variables which significantly contribute to the model. The
significance of the contribution of a variable to the model is estimated through type II
analysis. The type II analysis of the model refers to the level of certainty with which we
may reject the H0 hypothesis. This type of analysis attempts to prevent a false negative,
i.e. not rejecting the H0 hypothesis if it should have been rejected. As such, the initial
model included all the variables presented in this section as independent, explanatory
variables. As a variable was not found to contribute significantly to the model, it was
removed and a new model was built. Table 32 presents the type II analysis of the retained
model, and table 31 presents the overall significance of the model.

The overall representation of the model is very good, and the contribution of the
finally retained variables is also significantly confirmed. This model may, therefore, be
accepted in this form. It is to be noted that a considerable amount of the variables
discussed at the beginning of this section through binary χ2 analysis are not found to
contribute on a sufficiently significant level to the explanation of the formation of aspirations in this type of model. This reduces, for example, the socio-demographic measures
to age solely. Similarly, only a few of the modules of the questionnaire are retained for
this final model.

In this type of model, the first modality is fixed and used as a reference modality. As
such, there are no calculated values for each of the first modalities (1, and 0 for the
(dis)advantages à la Bourdieu) of all of the qualitative variables.
Following the specification of the model, with regards to equations 8.1 and 8.2, the interpretation of the parameters is not immediate. This interpretation may actually appear
rather counter-intuitive. Age, as the only quantitative variable among the independent
variables, may be interpreted as ‘one unit of change in the age, results in a 0.203 increase
of the logit’. As the logit is the ratio of two probabilities, the understanding of this ratio is
primordial. It is a ratio where the numerator is the probability of occurrence of modality j
or any modality lower than j. The denominator is the probability of the occurrence of any
modality strictly higher than j. As such when age increases, ceteris paribus, the ratio of
probability increases also. The increase of the ratio can be either explained by an increase
of the numerator and/or a decrease of the denominator. Thus, when age increases, the
probability of the occurrence of modality j or any modality below j increases. Likewise,
the probability of the occurrence of a modality superior to j decreases. Simply put, when
age increases, the probability of the occurrence of lower levels of aspirations increases,
whereas the probability of the occurrence of higher levels of aspirations decreases. As
such, with age, aspirations appear to be decreasing. This finding confirms previous research led with a similar methodology (Vos and Ballet 2018). Likewise, these findings
on the impact of age appear to be consistent with research led specifically within France.
This impact has been discussed for example by Dumora 2004 who identified the “age
group myths” as discussed in section 7.1.4.
It is also consistent with the multi-dimensional model of aspirations illustrated by
Hart in figure 3. One of the dimensions which affects aspirations in this figure is that
of the temporal horizon. This figure does nevertheless not show a necessary decrease in
163



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
aspirations but rather highlights that aspirations are subject to change over time. The
result of the model presented here regarding age may find meaning in the ‘change’ of aspirations as underlined by Mario Biggeri as he considers “the life cycle and the importance
of age in defining the relevance of a capability” (Biggeri 2007, p. 199). Aspirations may
be less school-related over time, as the pupils age and progressively detach from school,
reflecting on their future beyond being in school. In this process, aspirations that are
directly related to school (such as learning new things, for example) may be progressively
replaced with aspirations that extend beyond the scope of school alone (such as earning
a lot of money, for example).
It is to be noted that this interpretation appears to be rather counter-intuitive. In
more ‘traditional’ forms of regressions, a positive sign of a parameter indicates that the
associated independent variable positively evolves with the dependent variable. It appears
that this method is to be interpreted conversely. Since this may result in misunderstandings, some popular software for statistical analyses change the model’s equation (here
expressed in equation 8.2) for a more ‘intuitive’ interpretation of the parameters. This
is the case of Stata and R for example, which change the model by changing the signs
of all the αp xp to negative, resulting in logit(P(Y ≤ j)) being a sum of negative terms.
This does not change the model’s rationale but results in the parameters having opposite
signs, and thus varying in the same direction as the dependent variable.
The other variables being qualitative, their interpretation is similar to that of age, but
is done per modality and not in a continuous manner as for age. A rapid overlook of these
results shows that those which are found the most significant are the modalities that reflect
the ‘extremes’. This polarization of significance may translate that those respondents
who reported the lowest and/or the highest modalities are those whose aspirations are
consequently the most affected.
When looking at module 4, translated by the average subjective importance of school,
modalities 6 and 7 are the only ones that significantly impact the shaping of aspirations.
The associated parameters being increasingly positive indicates that those who consider
school to be important for their future have an increasingly higher probability of also
having higher school-related aspirations. The only significant parameters are those associated with the highest modalities. These can then been understood as pupils who
consider school to be important are also the pupils who associate the highest aspirations
to school. This can then be better understood in light of the French secondary schooling
system. As discussed in section 7.1.4, French schools suffer from a lack of recognition
on both an institutional level and from the perspective of their pupils. This has been
discussed specifically with regards to vocational education but appears to find a counterpart in the schools observed here. In other words, pupils who do not consider school
164



8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
to be important are less probable to have high school-related aspirations. It seems to be
important that pupils hold their school in high regard.
Module 6, namely the feeling of the impact of (dis)advantages à la Bourdieu, shows
the inversion of the sign between modality 1 and modality 4. As such respondents who do
not feel affected (be is positively or negatively) by the monetary and/or educational capital
detained by their parents tend to have lower school-related aspirations. Inversely, the
pupils who report the highest levels of perceived (dis)advantage have a higher probability
of having higher aspirations. To be consistent with previously discussed literature, this
result can be interpreted accordingly. It appears to be important that pupils feel supported
by their parents. With specific reference to the items in this module, it is important for a
pupil to feel that their parents are supportive of their schoolwork through encouragement,
but also through their knowledge and their financial situation. The impact of parent’s
resources on a child’s capabilities has been discussed by Biggeri, who finds that a “child’s
capabilities are at least partially affected by the capability set and achieved functionings
(as also by their means, i.e., assets, disposable income) of their parents” (Biggeri 2007,
p. 199). The findings presented here prolong the argument by Biggeri by suggesting that
it is the perception the children have of their parents “means” which affect them. It is also
to be noted here that only the two most ‘extreme’ modalities are found to be significant.
This may point at the idea that only those pupils who are in the most extreme situations
find their aspirations impacted by any (dis)advantages à la Bourdieu.
Such a finding is particularly interesting with regard to the specific case of French
high schools. To my knowledge, both Bourdieu and writings in his trail have measured
these (dis)advantages objectively, through parent’s wages, capital or jobs, and the pupil’s
educational achievement. This model then adds to these previous findings by pointing at
an impact on the subject level. Not only does it provide evidence for the existence of such
a relation, but it also shows that this impact is highly significant at the extremes. This
finding then ties in with the specific findings on the French secondary schooling system,
by confirming the existence of such a relationship using a different methodology.
Module 8 is translated into two different sections. On the one hand, the autonomy
of aspiration choice appears to be the most significant contributor to the formation of
aspirations in this model, with all but one modality significantly contributing. Moreover,
this variable contributes increasingly to the shaping of the pupil’s aspirations with higher
modalities. As such, the more the respondent has the feeling of being autonomously able
to determine her or his aspirations, the more this individual will have higher levels of
aspiration related to school. This result is therefore highly correlated with the literature
relating to agency and aspirations. It translates the fact that it appears important to the
respondents to be able to decide about their future by themselves. This sentiment has
165



CHAPTER 8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATION
previously been labeled the “sense of ownership of the aspiration” (Hart 2012, p. 84).
On the other hand, the findings in the second section relating conflictual aspirations
are initially startling, if not contradicting. They suggest that higher levels of conflictual
aspirations provide for higher levels of school-related aspirations. Different elements may
nevertheless explain such results. First of all and with regards to the results of the HCA
(group 2), the respondents who report the highest levels of conflicting aspirations, also
report the highest degrees of autonomy in the formation of their aspirations. Despite the
existence of conflicting aspirations, these conflicts may not affect the pupils as much in
the formation of their school-related aspirations as the feeling of being able to individually
decide what they want their future. In other words, these individuals feel that they are
autonomous enough to decide for themselves regardless of what other people want for
them.
Secondly, the aspirations measured in the last module (and thus constitute the dependent variable in this model) were strictly school induced. This finding may, therefore,
suggest that the respondents are aware of the fact that school may, independently from
their significant others, empower them to attain their valued aspirations. They may express here the fact that they are aware that school may help them achieve their aspirations
through a different canal. The awareness of this canal is a considerable argument for the
crucial importance of school and the ideal of social ascension. School may be perceived by
the respondents as a parallel medium for the shaping of their aspirations, which operates
out of the familial environment. This result is strengthened by the fact that the measured
aspirations were exclusively related to school and does not clash with existing literature.
Considering school as a canal of aspiration formation on its own, running parallel to that
which is ruled by significant others such as parents, siblings and friends allows conciliating
findings from existing literature and this model. Pupils find in school an alternative way
to realize what they aspire to. The instrumental role of education in the formation of
aspirations has been identified notably by Biggeri who finds that “education is a basic
capability with an intrinsic value means that it can be instrumental for other capabilities”
(Biggeri 2007, p. 199).
The importance of being educated is not only a basic capability that may be viewed
as instrumental for current aspirations but also entails the ability to develop capabilities
in the future and therefore empower individuals to realize their aspirations. This has been
discerned for example by Lorella Terzi who affirms that “the capability to be educated
plays a substantial role in the expansion of other capabilities as well as future ones, it can
be considered fundamental and foundational to different capabilities, and hence inherent
to the very possibility of leading a good life” (Terzi 2007, p. 30). As such, the fact that
the respondents identify the importance of school (also confirmed in module 4) which may
166



8.2. DATA ANALYSIS
independently lead them to the realization of their aspirations makes a strong argument for
the importance of school as such. The inherent ties with the attainment of higher levels
of well-being (translated as a “good life” by Terzi) also expand the initially discussed
instrumental role of education by human capital. Where human capital does not consider
well-being as an outcome of education, thus detaching itself from welfare economics, the
capability approach allows reinstating this intrinsic added value for education.

Chapter 9
Conclusion
he initial inquiry of this thesis has been from a theoretical perspective. The chronological review of economic literature, complemented with that from other social sciences
and humanities has permitted to identify the shift of focus operated by economists with regards to well-being. Where Jeremy Bentham provides a wide understanding of the notion
of well-being in economic terms, further literature has progressively emptied this notion
of its substance. This phenomenon has been very accurately referred to as “The Strange
Disappearance of Welfare Economics” (Atkinson 2001) and translates into economists
abandoning a meaningful definition of well-being (or welfare) for the profit of the notion
of utility. Utility, as experienced by a homo oeconomicus, has the property of being perfectly objectively measurable. In other words, utility can be homogeneously measured for
each and every individual. Such a measurement does allow economics to be non-value
laden and easily comparable across societies, countries, and continents. Nevertheless, this
appears to neglect some crucial aspects of what makes the individuality and the manner
people experience this utility, as Sen has pointed out (Sen 1980). The transformation of
welfare into utility procures considerable benefits in terms of statistical rigor which allows
economics to draw closer to the mathematization of natural sciences. This nevertheless
appears to omit the social share from the social science economics is.

T

The theoretical focus of economists on education appears to have undergone a similar
trajectory, where initially economists found the intrinsic value of education to the shaping
of people’s future, human capital theory has narrowed down this understanding to the
merely economic, and thus monetary, outcomes of education. This has resulted in public
education focusing on the attainment of diplomas and disregarding other crucial aspects
of education, which according to the statistical exploration proposed here, may result in
contradictory results.

169



CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSION
Likewise, mainstream economic theory has acknowledged the paramount Easterlin
Paradox, which economics is unable to explain in its existing shape. Despite Richard
Easterlin himself offering the solution of aspirations as a solution to this paradox, it
has not made its way into standard economic textbooks. Insights from psychology offer a
better understanding of aspirations but appear to be only sporadically used by economists.
The capability approach offers an elegant, powerful, and economically pertinent
framework for the evaluation of these notions. Amartya Sen’s initial definition and further
developments made by scholars from a variety of social sciences and humanities have allowed this theoretical corpus to flourish into a standalone framework for the evaluation of
a variety of societal considerations. The capability approach allows thinking about education in a much broader sense than standard economic theory permits. Where mainstream
economics focuses on productivity and salary outcomes of education, the capability approach permits to consider well-being in school and school-related aspirations as inherent
factors shaping economic educational outcomes. As the statistical findings in this thesis
suggest, when well-being and subjective evaluation of school are low, pupils do not aspire
to further education. This may result in lesser investment in education – in the human
capital understanding of education – on behalf of the pupil. As such, depriving students
of their well-being in school and their feeling of agency comes accompanied by crushed
aspirations.
The statistical findings of this thesis are unequivocal about the existent relation between on the one hand the pupil’s subjective views and evaluation of their school and its
provided education, and on the other hand well-being in school, a feeling of autonomy and
school-related aspirations. It is to be noted nevertheless that no relation of causality is
identified, the statistics ‘merely’ demonstrate the existence of a relation between these dimensions. Moreover, the nature nor the sense of an eventual causality of this relationship,
which may be multiple and highly complex, are not discussed. Nevertheless, the proposed
questionnaire is found to be, at least partially, pertinent through the application of both
multiple cluster analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. They allow showing the existence of links across the board, with regards to the retained modules which are exposed
in Part III. As such, pursuing educational policies for human capital reasons appear to
be inefficient. They fail to take into account the promotion of well-being and aspirations
in school, which are found to be pertinent dimensions for education.
This leads to the idea that educational policies based solely on the theoretical basis
offered by human capital, may prove inefficient, even with regards to its own goals. As
this thesis attempts to show, the various shapes of well-being in school affect the level of
aspirations pupils retain from their formal education. A pupil with low aspirations may,
in turn, not be willing to nor feeling capable of pursuing her or his education, be it in high
170



school or in university. Such a pupil may also not aspire to the ‘better’ jobs associated
with pursued education. If pupils fail to aspire school would then not serve its economic
purpose in providing its pupils with higher productivity and thus higher salaries. Failing
to recognize this, will ultimately undermine the very purpose of educational policies that
will underachieve their own purpose.
School also appears to play an important role in the formation of child agency. Both
the multidimensional statistic and the logit model employed in Part III show that those
pupils who have highly conflicting aspirations also display the highest school-related aspirations. Despite their aspirations being contrary to what others want for them, some
pupils still aspire to high school outcomes. This tends to show that some pupils may find
in school a parallel vector in which they may shape and foster their aspirations, in a certain manner liberating themselves from other external pressure. In this sense, school has
a major role to play in order to provide an environment in which these pupils may pursue
their aspirations, free of external constraints, most notably from their social surroundings.
Similarly, literature shows that pupils are highly impacted by their parent’s socioprofessional status. Through its statistical findings, this thesis points to a more nuanced
version of these findings. It finds that it might not be the socio-professional status per se
of the parents, but rather the feeling that the children retain of it that might affect their
levels of aspirations. This understanding of the influence of parent’s status is, therefore,
a major finding for schools and the associated policies. It reinforces the idea that school
ought to be an independent canal through which aspirations can be formulated, outside
the familial sphere of influence. School may, therefore, position itself as a vector where
aspirations may flourish, independently from other spheres of influences. The statistical
application to the French system proposed here furthermore identifies that, in some cases,
this role is not fulfilled by schools. Most notably, the results point at the career guidance
counselor (COP) and the CPE, who are not found to contribute sufficiently, maybe even
negatively to the formation of the pupil’s aspirations. There appears to be room for
improvement for schools to further fill in their role as a vector of aspirations for its pupils.
Finally, the empirical application also highlights the subjective importance of schools
and diplomas. Even though such a finding may appear trivial and intuitive, it has considerable implications for educational policies. Literature shows that French schools suffer
from a structural problem of the importance that is accorded to schools, both on an institutional and on an informal level. This has been theoretically discussed, for all types of
schools, and is confirmed in the empirical applications for the schools which participated
in this research. Bettering the subjective image their pupils hold of them may then enable
schools to foster higher aspirations for their pupils.

171



CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSION
It thus appears that education is applied in the ‘thin’ sense which is justified, defended, and promoted by now obsolete economics of education. This thesis finds that
education may be more beneficial if it were implemented in a much ‘thicker’ perspective.
Mainstream economists and policymakers may consider Judith Bessant’s advice, directly
drawn from Kantian philosophy, who finds that “the categorical imperative as an over
arching principle in youth policy-making (...) can determine that only actions that policy
makers are prepared to have applied to themselves are acceptable” (Bessant 2005, p. 108).
The line of thought developed throughout this thesis invites to further research on
behalf of economists. It attempts to stress the importance of economic science to further
investigate the underlying mechanisms at work in formal education, with as objective to
promote better educational (and maybe even economical) outcomes. Further research
may include technical expansions on the models presented here. Even though the social
desirability scale did not present any links with the other dimensions of the questionnaire,
it may nevertheless be used in a model that allows the individuals to be weighted. This
would require solid anchoring in psychological literature, but may provide deeper insight
into the type of data gathered here.
Another line of inquiry may include measures of the impact of the dimensions considered here on objective academic performance. The questionnaire used for this study did
not include any objective measure of the academic outcomes of each pupil. Including such
a module may enhance the understanding of the impact of those dimensions measured
here on the performance of students in school. This would allow for a deepened link with
traditional economic approaches. Such an inquiry may be strengthened through the usage
of panel data, allowing to following the evolution of the subjective modules presented here
coupled with objective academic performance, and even outcomes in terms of wages. This
would then allow deepening the link with economic outcomes considered in part I.
Further research in line with this thesis may also include the identification of links of
causality between the discussed dimensions. This could enhance understanding and allow
to properly target and gauge education policies. For the French government, this should
then apply to both the State and the more local level (Régions and Départements), which
should be provided with adequate tools and resources to implement these policies. These
policies should attempt to foster well-being in school as well as create and promote individual aspirations. This study also suggests that increased involvement of the considered
individuals – i.e. the pupils – into research may be beneficial for a better understanding
of the dimensions to promote in educational policies. This also opens research questions
relating to alternative educational models such as those proposed by Célestin Baptistin
Freinet or Maria Montessori. To what extent is it pertinent and beneficial for pupils to be
able to autonomously decide of their education, and what they learn from it? Can these
172



pedagogical methods provide children with reasonable amounts of pedagogical freedom,
allowing them to flourish with reason in the future?

173



CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSION

There are germs in human nature, and it becomes our concern to develop the
natural capacities proportionately, to unfold humanity from its seeds, and to see
to it that man attains his destiny. Animals attain their destiny of themselves,
and without being aware of it. Man is obliged to make an effort to attain his;
but this cannot be done if he never has a concept of it.

“the length of each bar shows the mean differences at age 30 in a number of outcomes
(health, health behaviors and labor market outcomes) between individuals who have
dropped out at the minimum compulsory school leaving age (16 years in Britain at the
time we consider), and those who have stayed on beyond age 16 to achieve a
post-compulsory educational qualification.” (Conti and Heckman 2014, p. 39)

Appendix F
Bentham’s “Hedonistic Calculus”,
Bentham, 1879
Begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to
be affected by it : and take an account,
1. Of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced
by it in the first instance.
2. Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first
instance.
3. Of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the
first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of
the first pain.
4. Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first.
This constitutes the fecundity of the first pain, and the impurity of the first
pleasure.
5. Sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side, and those of all
the pains on the other. The balance, if it be on the side of pleasure, will give
the good tendency of the act upon the whole, with respect to the interests of
that individual person; if on the side of pain, the bad tendency of it upon the
whole.
6. Take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be
concerned; and repeat the above process with respect to each. Sum up the
numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency, which the act has, with
respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is good
upon the whole : do this again with respect to each individual, in regard to
whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole : do this again with respect

to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the
whole. Take the balance; which, if on the side of pleasure, will give the general
good tendency of the act, with respect to the total number or community of
individuals concerned ; if on the side of pain, the general evil tendency, with
respect to the same community.

Où vont tous ces enfants dont pas un seul ne rit ?
Ces doux êtres pensifs que la fièvre maigrit ?
Ces filles de huit ans qu’on voit cheminer seules ?
Ils s’en vont travailler quinze heures sous des meules ;
Ils vont, de l’aube au soir, faire éternellement
Dans la même prison le même mouvement.
Accroupis sous les dents d’une machine sombre,
Monstre hideux qui mâche on ne sait quoi dans l’ombre,
Innocents dans un bagne, anges dans un enfer,
Ils travaillent. Tout est d’airain, tout est de fer.
Jamais on ne s’arrête et jamais on ne joue.
Aussi quelle pâleur ! la cendre est sur leur joue.
Il fait à peine jour, ils sont déjà bien las.
Ils ne comprennent rien à leur destin, hélas !
Ils semblent dire à Dieu :  Petits comme nous sommes,
Notre Père, voyez ce que nous font les hommes ! 
Ô servitude infâme imposée à l’enfant !
Rachitisme ! travail dont le souffle étouffant
Défait ce qu’a fait Dieu ; qui tue, œuvre insensée,
La beauté sur les fronts, dans les cœurs la pensée,
Et qui ferait — c’est là son fruit le plus certain —
D’Apollon un bossu, de Voltaire un crétin !
Travail mauvais qui prend l’âge tendre en sa serre,
Qui produit la richesse en créant la misère,

Qui se sert d’un enfant ainsi que d’un outil !
Progrès dont on demande :  Où va-t-il ? Que veut-il ?
Qui brise la jeunesse en fleur ! qui donne, en somme,
Une âme à la machine et la retire à l’homme !
Que ce travail, haı̈ des mères, soit maudit !
Maudit comme le vice où l’on s’abâtardit,
Maudit comme l’opprobre et comme le blasphème !
Ô Dieu ! qu’il soit maudit au nom du travail même,
Au nom du vrai travail, sain, fécond, généreux,
Qui fait le peuple libre et qui rend l’homme heureux !
