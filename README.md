# Text Mining and NLP for French Higher Education Theses Processing and Similarities Detection
In this project, 50 PhD theses that were defended in French higher institutions were web-scraped in form of PDF from [theses.fr](https://theses.fr/), converted to text files, had their script languages detected, examined through TF-IDF vectorization, examined through N-gram probabilities (bigrams, trigrams, and quadrigrams). 
Furthermore, a document similarity analysis was performed on a chosen 10 theses by calculating the cosine similarities between each document of the 10 and the rest.
